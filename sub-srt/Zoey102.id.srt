1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,446
* Lakukan-jadilah-lakukan-lakukan - lakukan, oh *

2
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,452
* Lakukan-jadilah-lakukan-lakukan - lakukan, oh *

3
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:23,857
* Lakukan-jadilah-lakukan-lakukan - lakukan, oh *

4
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:28,196
* Lakukan-jadilah-lakukan-lakukan - lakukan, oh *

5
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:31,599
Zoey, aku sudah mencintaimu sejak aku melihatmu.

6
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,602
Anda menjatuhkan saya dari kaki saya, ingat?

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:37,871
Saya tahu bahkan saat itu, dan saya pikir Anda juga tahu,

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,808
bahwa apa yang kita miliki adalah sesuatu yang istimewa,

9
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,176
sesuatu yang kuat,

10
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,211
sesuatu yang nyata.

11
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:48,082
Saat aku menatap matamu, aku melihat seluruh hidup kita.

12
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,983
Hari-hari baik, hari-hari buruk,

13
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,652
ulang tahun, hari tua.

14
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:54,855
I... Aku ingin melakukan semuanya, Zoey!

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,558
Selama aku bisa melakukannya denganmu.

16
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,860
Dan tentu saja, itu tidak akan sempurna,

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,796
tapi tidak ada di dunia ini yang sempurna,

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,098
kecuali kamu.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
Saya siap membangun kehidupan,

20
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,437
keluarga, masa depan, bersama,

21
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:12,706
tapi itu semua dimulai dengan satu pertanyaan.

22
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:14,975
Zoey...

23
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,646
Zoey...

24
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:21,582
Uh, siapa nama belakangmu lagi?

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,485
Brooks.

26
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,521
Zoey Brooks, maukah kamu menikah denganku?

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,527
Apa yang kamu lakukan?

28
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,829
Aku meminta tanganmu.

29
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,997
Kami sudah berkencan dua kali.

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,932
Dua kencan sempurna yang ingin saya ubah

31
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,170
menjadi selamanya, jadi, maukah kamu membuatku menjadi yang paling bahagia--

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,037
Tidak, tidak, jelas tidak, sama sekali tidak.

33
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,639
Tidak dalam sejuta tahun, tidak!

34
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,341
Yah, mungkin jika Anda mengatakan" ya " sekarang,

35
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,076
dan kemudian kita bisa membicarakannya nanti.

36
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,378
Byron, berdiri.

37
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,812
Ya. Hai.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,216
Kau tahu ini aneh, kan?

39
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,750
Ya, aku tahu ini aneh.

40
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,120
Hanya, saya berusia 30 setengah tahun dan saya tinggal bersama ibu saya,

41
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,556
dan saya penyanyi utama dari band cover Maroon 5.

42
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,226
Saya tidak benar-benar mendapatkan banyak kencan kedua.

43
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,262
Terima kasih atas kejujuranmu, Byron.

44
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,398
Saya yakin ada seseorang di luar sana untuk Anda,

45
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,433
itu bukan aku.

46
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,035
Jadi saya harus pergi.

47
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,538
Ya, itu, eh, itu masuk akal.

48
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,872
Kau akan baik-baik saja?

49
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,108
Oh ya, aku, uh, ya, aku akan baik-baik saja.

50
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,210
Baiklah.

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,211
Jadi aku akan meneleponmu?

52
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,678
Tolong jangan.

53
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,713
Oke.

54
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,348
- Selamat! - Selamat!

55
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,919
* Oh, buat aku berakhir *

56
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:35,155
* Aku semua yang aku inginkan *

57
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,891
* Studi jalan kaki *

58
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,362
* Dalam demonologi *

59
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,765
* Hei, sangat senang kamu bisa berhasil *

60
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:48,369
* Ya, sekarang kamu benar-benar berhasil *

61
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:55,376
* Hei, sangat senang kamu bisa melakukannya sekarang *

62
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,986
Anda sedang menonton LOVE: Fully Charged.

63
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,890
Selamat datang di Danau Malibu yang cerah, California,

64
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,493
di mana 12 single seksi akan menghabiskan musim panas

65
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,495
mencari pasangan yang cocok untuk mereka,

66
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,265
dengan hadiah utama cinta sejati

67
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,399
atau mobil.

68
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:19,567
Musim ini, kami telah mengambil

69
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,302
Coupe Pontiac Solstice tua yang bodoh

70
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,636
dan kami telah mengubahnya

71
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,772
menjadi kendaraan listrik impian Anda.

72
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,576
Dengan jangkauan 300 mil dan kemampuan mengemudi sendiri,

73
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,712
ini adalah LUV-6 yang terisi penuh.

74
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,614
Sekarang kencangkan sabuk pengaman karena minggu ini,

75
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,416
Jordan B. dan Jordyn J.

76
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,017
pergi kencan pertama mereka.

77
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,288
Ada apa?

78
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,358
Saat ini saya mengendarai Ford Fiesta 2009,

79
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,959
tidak ada AC, tidak ada kaca spion,

80
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,928
jadi, Anda tahu saya siap untuk Pontiac itu.

81
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,030
Tapi Jordyn J. terlihat sangat seksi hari ini,

82
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,366
jadi, ya, saya kira kepala saya mulai berputar!

83
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,935
Kamu terlihat sangat seksi hari ini.

84
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,405
- Kau mau anggur? - Ya, terima kasih.

85
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,275
Jadi lihat, mengapa kau memilihku untuk berkencan?

86
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,279
Uh...

87
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,483
Uh...

88
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,319
Um...

89
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,686
Suruh dia pergi. Cepat, cepat!

90
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,957
Yah, um...

91
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,591
Uh...

92
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,628
Uh...

93
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,730
Oh, syukurlah.

94
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,064
Misterius...

95
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,933
Karena kamu misterius

96
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,568
dan cantik,

97
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,070
dan kamu menarik perhatianku begitu kamu masuk.

98
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,639
Saya belum merasakan hubungan seperti ini

99
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:32,906
dengan orang lain di vila,

100
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,808
dan saya senang melihat ke mana perginya ini.

101
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,446
Saya juga senang melihat kemana perginya ini juga.

102
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,147
- Untuk kita. - Untuk kita.

103
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,016
Dan potong!

104
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,918
- Baiklah, itu luka. - Pindah.

105
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,287
Itu bagus, kalian! Hal yang sangat menyenangkan.

106
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,256
Jordyn J., untuk pengakuan dosa.

107
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,491
Hei, bagaimana kabarku?

108
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,426
Oh, berhasil, seperti yang kita latih.

109
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,495
Amerika akan menyayangimu.

110
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,564
Kurasa aku tidak bisa melakukan ini tanpamu.

111
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,599
Bagaimana Anda selalu tahu apa yang harus, seperti, katakan?

112
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,701
Oh, itu hanya bagian dari pekerjaan, Jordan B.

113
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,504
Sekarang, jika Anda permisi, saya harus mendapatkan promosi.

114
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:04,838
Tangkap mereka, Zo!

115
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,446
Jadi pertanyaan yang saya ajukan kepada Anda,

116
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,115
tim produksi saya yang brilian, adalah ini.

117
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,688
Apakah semua orang melihat apa yang mereka lakukan di Polisi Anjing ?

118
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,224
Ya, itu omong kosong yang aneh.

119
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,060
Aneh, baru...

120
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:32,600
sial, dan itulah yang aku inginkan darimu untuk pertunjukan kita.

121
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,103
Saya ingin ide-ide baru yang aneh

122
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,237
atau...

123
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,872
kau dipecat.

124
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,774
- Membuat semua orang telanjang? - Tidak!

125
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,743
Bagaimana jika kita memasangkan seseorang dengan hewan?

126
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,244
Kami melakukannya musim lalu!

127
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,714
Bagaimana jika kita mengganti semua gadis dengan ibu mereka?

128
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,016
Itu ide yang luar biasa karena jika ada satu hal

129
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,419
Amerika Tengah suka, itu wanita tua.

130
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,920
Tidak, tidak diuji dengan baik.

131
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,822
Bagaimana jika Jordan B. melamar?

132
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,657
Bagaimana jika Jordan B. melamar?

133
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,227
Semuanya diam. Greg, kau punya ide?

134
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,098
Bagaimana jika Jordan B.

135
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,401
diusulkan untuk Jordyn J.?

136
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,407
Sebuah proposal... pada kencan kedua?

137
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,679
Itu adalah shiznit yang aneh,

138
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,348
dan itu sangat jenius, itu hanya bisa berhasil.

139
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:22,683
Bagaimana Anda datang dengan ini?

140
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:23,717
Aku tidak tahu!

141
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,285
Aku tahu.

142
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,821
- Karena kau berhubungan denganku. - Sebenarnya, itu ideku!

143
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,957
Oke, jadi alasan saya mengadakan pertemuan ini,

144
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,058
setiap tahun, untuk final,

145
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,729
Saya mengumpulkan tim yang paling cerdas dan terbaik.

146
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,998
Tim yang akan tinggal bersama saya

147
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,068
di situs untuk final kami adalah...

148
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,448
Ini adalah bagaimana Anda melakukan TV.

149
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,284
- Taylor! - Ya!

150
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,086
Brian!

151
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,221
- Aiden. - Ya!

152
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,223
- Rafi! - Ya!

153
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,325
Dan tentu saja, Greg.

154
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,729
Pasti Greg. Semua orang lain... menjadi lebih baik.

155
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,432
Sampai jumpa di atas es. Rapat ditunda.

156
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,608
- Siri, mulai treadmill saya. - Kelley, aku perlu bicara denganmu.

157
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,743
Oke, saya sangat sibuk, jadi cepatlah.

158
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,578
Ini tentang pilihan Anda untuk final langsung.

159
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,179
Saya pikir Anda membuat kesalahan besar.

160
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,215
Merah muda atau merah muda cerah untuk gadis baru?

161
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,584
- Telanjang. - Dia tidak bisa telanjang.

162
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,953
Tidak, tidak, itu warna. Warnanya telanjang.

163
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,389
Apakah saya harus melakukan pekerjaan semua orang di sekitar sini?!

164
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,227
Saya akan menjadi anggota tim yang sangat berharga

165
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,530
karena saya telah mengerjakan acara itu lebih lama dari siapa pun.

166
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,465
- Semua kontestan mempercayai saya. - Tuan Kevyn, pertanyaan dari Legal.

167
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,068
Apakah kita pernah mendapat izin untuk menggunakan Pontiac untuk mobil?

168
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,270
Kami adalah acara nomor satu di jaringan.

169
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,006
Kami tidak bertanya pada Pontiac, kami memberi tahu mereka.

170
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,207
Faktanya, beri tahu Pontiac, jika mereka tidak menyukainya,

171
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,345
mereka bisa mencium kacang kecilku.

172
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,713
Kamu sudah selesai atau kamu masih membutuhkanku?

173
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,015
Saya memiliki ide yang lebih baik daripada siapa pun!

174
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,184
Proposal itu adalah ide saya!

175
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,153
Lihat, Debbie,

176
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,889
jika Anda tidak menyukai pekerjaan Anda, saya bisa membelikan Anda yang baru.

177
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,891
Pengajuan tugas rekaman.

178
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,492
Tunggu, tidak, tidak, bukan itu--

179
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,563
Tugas pengiriman rekaman!

180
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,434
Woo! CINTA: Terisi Penuh!

181
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,006
Tolong jangan hari ini.

182
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,543
Kumohon.

183
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,280
Ini adalah set tertutup, saya ingin memberi tahu kalian.

184
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,017
Sejujurnya, saya tidak suka foto itu. Aku akan menandatanganinya.

185
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,919
Saya harus pergi dalam waktu sekitar dua detik.

186
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,254
- Tapi ini seperti gambar terbaik! - Baiklah.

187
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,294
Ya Tuhan.

188
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,495
Butuh tumpangan?

189
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,767
Oh, ayolah, bergembiralah.

190
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,703
Inilah yang terjadi saat Anda masih mengemudi

191
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,371
PT Cruiser ayahmu, dari SMA.

192
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,041
Kau akan membutuhkan mobil baru, sayang.

193
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,376
Aku baik-baik saja. Saya suka mobil saya.

194
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,379
Bukankah gila aku memulai sebagai magang Anda,

195
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,116
dan sekarang seperti, kita... seperti, saya seperti...

196
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,418
seperti sedikit di atas... seperti itu gila.

197
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,588
Yang gila adalah Kelley mengizinkan Anda membawa pulang mobil pertunjukan

198
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,089
tapi aku bahkan tidak bisa membuatnya melihatku.

199
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,626
Itu karena Kelley terobsesi padaku.

200
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:19,827
Ini akan menjadi seperti kotor

201
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,561
jika itu tidak datang dengan beberapa keuntungan.

202
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,996
Saya hanya memikirkan semua hal

203
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,698
Saya bermimpi tentang di sekolah menengah,

204
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,466
dan sekarang aku di sini, dan itu seperti,

205
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,068
apakah ini dia, apakah ini mimpinya?

206
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,338
Sungguh menjijikkan seberapa sering Anda berbicara tentang sekolah menengah.

207
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,309
Tidak, tapi serius, langgar saja aturannya.

208
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,411
Ada dua tipe orang kan?

209
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,147
Hiu dan ikan kecil.

210
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,183
Saya jelas hiu,

211
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,852
dan kau-kau ikan kecil.

212
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:45,886
Aku bukan ikan kecil.

213
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,988
Oke, kalau begitu buktikan.

214
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,891
Jika Anda ingin perhatian Kelley, lakukan saja apa yang saya lakukan.

215
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,392
Apa yang kamu lakukan?

216
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,295
Saya memintanya untuk telanjang dan kemudian saya memerasnya.

217
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,768
Aku bercanda!

218
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,670
Kau gila!

219
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,874
Um, tidak, aku melamar pekerjaan itu.

220
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,044
Jika itu membuatmu merasa lebih baik,

221
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,546
Saya benar-benar berpikir promosi itu milik Anda.

222
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,448
Anda layak mendapatkannya lebih dari siapa pun,

223
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,117
termasuk aku.

224
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,119
Saya menghasilkan terlalu banyak uang.

225
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,121
Anda ingin pergi ke sushi?

226
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,956
Bawa aku ke SUGARFISH.

227
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,958
Membawamu ke SUGARFISH.

228
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,559
Archer!

229
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,028
Tidak apa-apa.

230
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,930
Ini mendorong dirinya sendiri, kita bisa santai saja.

231
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,231
Duduk, santai.

232
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,966
Pintu ditutup.

233
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,396
- Hei! - Hai!

234
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,999
- Apakah kamu mendapatkannya? - Promosinya? Tidak.

235
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,402
Seksisme masih hidup dan sehat di Hollywood, sayang!

236
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,738
Apa?!

237
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,005
Orang-orang bodoh itu.

238
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,407
Tapi tidak, paketnya, maksud saya paketnya,

239
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,176
Oh, uh, ya.

240
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,245
- Lima menit, Nn. Pensky. - Terima kasih.

241
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,580
Kau di London? Saya pikir keynote Anda tidak sampai minggu depan.

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,249
Kami sedang merekamnya untuk peluncuran produk.

243
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,017
Buka. Saya hanya punya beberapa menit.

244
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,255
TekMate baru?! Ini bahkan belum keluar!

245
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,290
Saya kira membayar untuk mengenal penemunya!

246
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,425
Apakah kamu tidak ingin menyalakannya?

247
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,595
Wow, telepon tembus pandang yang tidak bisa dipecahkan.

248
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,865
Ini bahkan lebih baik secara langsung!

249
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,399
Ya Tuhan.

250
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,969
Apakah saya memberi tahu Anda bahwa saya dilamar malam itu

251
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,037
pada kencan kedua?

252
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,505
Ini seperti detik kita menginjak usia 30 tahun,

253
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,275
semua orang menjadi terobsesi...

254
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,344
"Maukah kamu menjadi pelayanku..."

255
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,512
Tunggu, apa itu...

256
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,747
Tidak.

257
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:54,915
Diam!

258
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,683
Quinn dan Logan akan menikah!

259
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,185
Maaf.

260
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,354
Dia bertemu saya di London dan mengejutkan saya dengan sebuah perjalanan

261
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,456
ke Belanda. Dia bahkan menyewa pesawat,

262
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,893
yang sangat tidak bertanggung jawab terhadap lingkungan, tapi...

263
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,694
- Tentu saja dia melakukannya! - Tentu saja dia melakukannya!

264
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,029
Jadi, saya baru saja menelepon Michael,

265
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,898
dan dia terobsesi menjadi petugas.

266
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:14,501
Dan saya mematikan telepon dengan Chase, dan dia ketakutan!

267
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,004
Oh. Hai-hai, Zoey!

268
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,171
Jadi kamu dengar.

269
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,473
- Dia akhirnya menjawab ya! - Hei, Logan!

270
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,376
Dan hanya butuh waktu 50 kali. Selamat!

271
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,879
Oke, jadi saya tahu ini hampir seperti terlalu cepat,

272
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,815
tapi pernikahannya harus tanggal 26 Agustus.

273
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,582
Singkat cerita, peluncuran produk,

274
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,919
ini satu-satunya saat saya bebas selama dua tahun ke depan.

275
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,855
Dan saya tidak tahu apa yang akan saya lakukan tanpa sahabat saya di sana.

276
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,289
Jadi bagaimana menurutmu?

277
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,394
Anda tahu, saya pikir saya harus bekerja,

278
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,263
tapi sepertinya aku benar-benar bebas!

279
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,699
Terima kasih. Hei, kau mau ambilkan aku air sebelum aku pergi?

280
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,568
Apapun untuk tunanganku.

281
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,005
Zo, kamu tahu itu akan baik-baik saja, kan?

282
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,241
Chase akan ada di sana. Ini akan baik-baik saja.

283
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,343
Lebih dari baik-baik saja, itu akan menyenangkan.

284
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,278
Tidak ada yang bisa melihatmu lagi kecuali aku.

285
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,913
Ini akan menjadi reuni yang kita semua butuhkan.

286
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,181
Aku harus pergi, sayang.

287
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,850
Silakan sambut penemu

288
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,751
Quinn Pensky.

289
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,927
Aku butuh minuman lagi.

290
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,128
* Anda dulu mengenal saya... *

291
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,330
"Tidak ada yang melihatmu lagi."

292
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,966
Aku melihat orang-orang.

293
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,600
Hanya karena aku sudah lama tidak melihatnya

294
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,235
bukan berarti kita bukan teman, kan?

295
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,237
Saya punya banyak teman, bertemu banyak orang.

296
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,306
Bahkan jika saya memiliki pilihan, saya terlalu sibuk.

297
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,975
Saya sangat sibuk sepanjang waktu.

298
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:32,145
* Dulu aku malaikatmu, sekarang aku berjalan keluar pintumu *

299
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,047
* Kamu bilang aku berubah menjadi jahat *

300
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,083
* Saya akan mengatakan bahwa saya akhirnya murni *

301
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,185
* Bersinar terang di bayanganku *

302
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,353
* Pikir saya kehilangan diri saya sebelumnya *

303
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,256
* Menahan saya, mengikat saya di dalam sangkar *

304
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:45,492
* Harus mengubah hidup saya *

305
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,128
* Karena aku tahu kamu akan tetap sama *

306
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,764
* Tidak dapat melihat Anda menghalangi jalan saya *

307
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,467
* Saya dapat melihat dengan jelas sekarang, sekarang, sekarang *

308
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,104
* Dulu kamu mengenalku, sekarang kamu tidak mengenalku *

309
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:02,242
* Anda dulu menghipnotis saya, melakukannya dengan sangat mudah *

310
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,045
* Dulu kamu mengenalku, sekarang kamu tidak mengenalku *

311
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,980
Tentu saja saya punya pertanyaan.

312
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,216
Siapa yang menyelinap ke sekolah Minggu?

313
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,051
Siapa yang mencuri Subaru?

314
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,021
Dan siapa yang menikam Sarabella Simson?

315
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:19,326
Saya Stacey Dillsen, dan ini adalah Pembantaian Favorit saya.

316
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:25,098
* Aku seperti bunga yang mekar sejak aku meninggalkanmu *

317
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,034
* Tidak tahu apa yang saya lakukan *

318
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,436
- Woo! - Buat permintaan!

319
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,573
* Tahu kamu berubah menjadi jahat, kamu bilang aku kehilangan akal sehatku *

320
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,144
* Tidak, kamu tidak akan melakukan hal seperti itu padaku *

321
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:40,813
* Menahan saya, mengikat saya di dalam sangkar *

322
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,615
* Harus mengubah hidup saya *

323
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,518
* Karena aku tahu kamu akan tetap sama... *

324
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,622
Apakah ada kerang di dalamnya?

325
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,926
Tidak ada kerang!

326
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,394
* Sekarang kamu tidak *

327
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:59,299
* Anda dulu menghipnotis saya, melakukannya dengan sangat mudah *

328
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,502
* Dulu kamu mengenalku, sekarang kamu tidak mengenalku *

329
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:19,119
* Jangan menelusuri rol kamera Anda *

330
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,055
* Begitu banyak yang tidak Anda ketahui *

331
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,825
* Bahwa kamu lupa *

332
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,194
* Perjalanan yang luar biasa *

333
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,629
* Cara Anda dapat membalik *

334
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,465
* Melalui semua bagian yang baik darinya *

335
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,303
* Saya seharusnya tidak melakukannya *

336
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,039
* Urutan kronologis *

337
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,408
* Dan tidak lain hanyalah penyiksaan *

338
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,443
* Gulir terlalu jauh ke belakang... *

339
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,482
* Saya tidak ingin melihatnya *

340
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,085
* Tapi saya tidak bisa menghapusnya... *

341
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,887
Apa yang terjadi? Ya, berikan padaku.

342
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,225
Psh! Kerja bagus. Ya? Oke, ini dia.

343
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,228
Oh, ya. Kau hebat dalam hal itu.

344
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,796
Oh, ya, Anda ingin fistbump? Ayo pergi. Baiklah.

345
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,469
* Semua yang terbaik *

346
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,613
Chase, aku benar-benar minta maaf tentang Hawaii.

347
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,583
Tapi kami masih anak-anak. Bisakah kita bicara?

348
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,557
Oh, tidak, tidak, tidak, tidak.

349
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,928
Oh, tidak. Oh...

350
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,080
Anda sedang menonton LOVE: Fully Charged.

351
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,315
Jangan mengintip. Jangan mengintip. Jangan mengintip.

352
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,983
Oke, tunggu. Bertahanlah.

353
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,187
Kau siap? Tiga, dua, satu.

354
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,389
Ta-da!

355
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:06,193
Jordan B., ada apa? Apakah kamu melakukan semua ini?

356
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,560
Tidak.

357
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,463
Maksudku, ya.

358
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,566
Jordyn J., Aku tahu ini kencan kedua kita,

359
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,867
tapi ada sesuatu yang ingin kutanyakan padamu.

360
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,337
Oh, Tuhan.

361
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,905
Ya Tuhan!

362
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,708
Ya?

363
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,545
Um...

364
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,314
Ya?

365
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,082
Um...

366
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,583
Um...

367
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,051
Apa yang salah dengan dia?

368
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,253
Um...

369
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,487
Greg, ada apa dengannya?

370
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,123
Entahlah. Dia tidak pernah seperti ini.

371
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,992
Yo, maafkan aku, tapi sebelum aku melakukan ini, bisakah aku bicara dengan Zoey?

372
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,794
Siapa Zoey?

373
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,163
Ah!

374
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,437
Zoey, kau mempermalukanku.

375
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,805
Jaringan menyukai gagasan Greg tentang proposal tersebut,

376
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,941
dan kemudian Jordan B. berlutut dan seperti,

377
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,745
"Eh, aku butuh Zoey. Dimana Zoey? Zoey, dimana Zoey?"

378
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,682
Nah, di mana saja kamu, Zoey?

379
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,218
Anda menempatkan saya pada tugas pengiriman rekaman.

380
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,887
Anda tidak di sini untuk menjawab.

381
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,956
Anda di sini untuk mendengarkan.

382
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,393
Saya tidak suka Jordan B.

383
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,428
Dia bertingkah seperti bayi.

384
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,797
Tapi Amerika tidak setuju.

385
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,199
Ini mungkin rambutnya.

386
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,967
Dan jika prediksi saya benar,

387
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,069
dia akan pergi ke final.

388
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,639
Dan ketika dia melakukannya, aku membutuhkanmu...

389
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,641
menjadi...

390
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,477
ibunya.

391
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,212
Ibu?

392
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,880
Ya.

393
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,288
Saat dia "lapar", Anda akan memberinya makan.

394
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:44,891
Saat dia pemarah, Anda akan memeriksa diapey-nya.

395
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,559
Dan saat kita ditayangkan,

396
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,697
Anda akan berada di telinganya untuk memberitahunya apa yang harus dikatakan,

397
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:55,368
karena aku tidak akan malu lagi.

398
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,370
Apakah ini berarti saya ada di tim langsung?

399
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,439
- Ya, baiklah, di tim siaran langsung. - Ya!

400
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,841
Oh, Tuhan.

401
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,347
Tidak, uh, tunggu, aku tidak bisa memberitahumu berapa lama aku menunggu untuk melakukan ini,

402
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,948
tapi saya tidak tahu apakah saya bisa menerimanya

403
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,218
karena ini akhir pekan yang sama dengan pernikahan sahabatku--

404
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,852
Aku tidak bertanya, oke?

405
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,722
Apapun rencanamu, batalkan, oke?

406
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,923
Kau sibuk.

407
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,893
- Terima kasih. - Terima kasih banyak.

408
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,031
Satu lagi.

409
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,500
Satu untuk satu. Hanya sedikit.

410
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,881
Quinn, ini aku, pelayan kehormatanmu.

411
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,517
Aku tidak bisa datang ke pernikahanmu.

412
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,353
Saya tahu ini adalah hari terpenting dalam hidup Anda,

413
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,820
tapi saya harus bekerja.

414
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,022
Oh, aku benci ini.

415
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,458
Zoey!

416
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,192
- Hai! Oh! - Hai!

417
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,662
Ya Tuhan, aku sangat senang kau ada di sini.

418
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,430
Keluargaku sudah membuatku gila.

419
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,798
Bubbe bilang aku terlalu pucat.

420
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,467
Ibuku pikir aku harus menambahkan ikat pinggang ke gaunnya.

421
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,235
Dan lirik adik Logan adalah -- / Quinn.

422
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,703
- Lirik. Hai. - Aku perlu bicara denganmu

423
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,137
- tentang hadiah pernikahanmu. - Sekarang?

424
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,239
Ya.

425
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,274
Hadiah saya adalah lagu asli.

426
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:08,475
Itu sangat bijaksana.

427
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,243
Bahwa saya akan tampil

428
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,111
saat Anda berjalan menyusuri lorong.

429
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,349
Lyric adalah penyanyi / penulis lagu yang sedang naik daun.

430
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,585
Saya mengkhususkan diri pada EDM / deep house / country-folk.

431
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,020
- Ini seperti semuanya. - Lirik, tentang hadiahnya--

432
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,789
Shh.

433
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,263
Ooh, itu sangat bagus.

434
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,832
Eh, maaf, melodinya baru saja datang padaku.

435
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:38,538
Aku harus meletakkan ini. Siri, buka memo suara.

436
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,573
Apa yang akan saya berikan untuk kepercayaan diri

437
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,275
dari anak dana perwalian.

438
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,177
Um, Quinn,

439
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,714
ada sesuatu yang benar-benar perlu saya bicarakan dengan Anda.

440
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,382
Siap, Nona Pensky?

441
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,717
Oh.

442
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,819
Maaf, aku -- aku harus pergi.

443
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,021
- Bicara nanti? Oke. - Ya, oke.

444
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,823
Terima kasih.

445
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,161
Kuharap dia muncul.

446
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,297
Zoey? Pelayan kehormatan? Mengapa dia tidak mau?

447
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,598
Karena dia tidak pernah muncul.

448
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,066
Dan bukannya kita tidak mengundangnya.

449
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,135
Sekarang setelah Anda menyebutkannya, saya bekerja dengan Quinn selama lima tahun

450
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,471
- dan aku masih belum bertemu dengannya. - Teori saya adalah

451
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,272
Saya pikir dia masih terjebak pada mantannya, Chase.

452
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,875
- Pria terbaik? - Dari SMA.

453
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,877
Ini menyedihkan. Mereka seharusnya menghabiskan musim panas

454
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,813
setelah tahun senior bersama di Hawaii,

455
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,114
tapi pasti ada sesuatu yang terjadi,

456
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,883
karena mereka putus, dan saya rasa tidak

457
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,452
dia memiliki hubungan sejak saat itu.

458
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,919
Oh, tidak. Hal yang buruk.

459
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,055
Dan jika dia muncul, itu akan menjadi tidak nyaman,

460
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,658
karena kurasa dia tidak tahu Chase punya pacar.

461
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,293
Yang serius. Kami makan malam bersama mereka di Baltimore

462
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,095
ketika saya sedang tur untuk pod saya.

463
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,229
Dia juga seorang guru.

464
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,565
Mereka sangat imut bersama.

465
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,435
- Astaga. - Zoey?

466
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,171
- Apakah kamu baik-baik saja? - Aku baik-baik saja. Aku sangat baik.

467
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,108
Pelayan kehormatanmu telah tiba!

468
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,977
- Hei! - Hai!

469
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,413
Sepertinya Anda bisa menggunakan sedikit minuman.

470
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,981
Terima kasih.

471
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,191
Nona Pensky, kamu terlihat cantik!

472
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,059
Senang bertemu denganmu, Zoey.

473
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,862
Oh, ini ibuku, nenek Quinn.

474
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,131
Bukan nenek. Tidak pernah nenek.

475
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,232
Bubbe.

476
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,333
Senang bertemu denganmu.

477
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,768
Bagaimana kabar keluargamu?

478
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,470
Apa yang sedang dilakukan adik kecilmu itu?

479
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,406
Tidak sedikit lagi.

480
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,908
Dia memiliki dua anak dan saudara kembar dalam perjalanan, jika Anda percaya.

481
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,243
Anda semua harus berhenti tumbuh dewasa.

482
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,112
- Mm-hmm. - Zoey!

483
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,315
- Sudah lama sekali! - Hai, Stacey!

484
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,885
Dan kau pasti Camille.

485
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,054
Ya, senang akhirnya bertemu denganmu.

486
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,924
Kami hanya ingin tahu apakah kau akan berhasil atau tidak.

487
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,760
Aku tahu. Aku terlambat, tapi aku ada di rumah pacarku.

488
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,395
Lupa waktu.

489
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,397
Pacar? Sejak kapan?

490
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,765
Ini baru-baru ini, tapi cukup tentang saya.

491
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,300
Sekarang, jangan membuat kita menunggu sampai pernikahan, Zoey.

492
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,702
Ayo, beri kami deets.

493
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,003
Ya, ya. Siapa namanya?

494
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,741
Eh, miliknya... namanya, um...

495
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,375
um...

496
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,477
Hemsworth.

497
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,211
Hugo Hemsworth.

498
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,514
Hemsworth? Apa dia orang Australia?

499
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,815
Ya.

500
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,885
Seperti Liam dan Chris Hemsworth?

501
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,954
Mereka adalah sepupu jauh.

502
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,722
- Oh! Apa yang dia lakukan? - Apa?

503
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,425
Dia seorang dokter.

504
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,893
Ahli bedah, sebenarnya.

505
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,095
- Wow! - Dr. Hemsworth.

506
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,163
Dia sudah siap.

507
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:18,431
Oh, syukurlah.

508
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,040
Dia tampak hebat.

509
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,112
Kamu terlihat luar biasa.

510
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,418
Bagaimana perasaanmu?

511
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,221
Seperti aku lebih suka menikah dengan jas lab.

512
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,857
Ini sempurna. Kau sempurna.

513
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,493
Kau sedikit pucat.

514
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,260
Bisa menggunakan ikat pinggang.

515
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:54,166
- Sampai ketemu lagi. - Baiklah. Dah!

516
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,302
- Uh, hei, di mana mobilmu? - Oh, ada di toko.

517
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,738
- Oh. Apa kau butuh tumpangan? - Itu sangat manis,

518
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,139
tapi pacarku menjemputku.

519
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,142
- Apa-apa? - Sebenarnya, mobilnya.

520
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,077
Itu mengemudi sendiri.

521
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,779
Mengemudi sendiri?

522
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,414
- Fancy! - Ya.

523
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,985
Uh, permisi? Pacar? Apa yang saya lewatkan?

524
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,386
Inikah yang ingin kamu bicarakan?

525
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,455
Ya Tuhan, apakah kamu membawanya ke pesta pernikahan?

526
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,657
- Ini sangat besar! - Tidak, tidak, tidak.

527
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,191
Sudah terlambat untuk menambahkan nilai tambah.

528
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,328
Tidak, tidak. Saya benar-benar mengirim SMS ke perencana pernikahan kami.

529
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,331
Yang mengingatkan saya, maukah Anda pergi ke Santa Barbara?

530
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,767
Logan mengubah ukuran cincinnya di tempat yang mewah,

531
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,169
dan tidak ada orang yang lebih aku percayai selain kamu.

532
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,671
Apa kau keberatan?

533
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,774
- Aku tidak keberatan. Aku akan melakukannya. - Terima kasih.

534
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,543
Oh! Aku mencintaimu.

535
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,511
- Mwah. - Aku menyayangimu. Dah!

536
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,482
Dan saat itulah saya tahu saya harus melakukan keduanya:

537
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,284
pernikahan dan final.

538
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:48,120
* Dulu bayi, dulu wanita *

539
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,223
* Pikir Anda adalah kekasih yang sempurna... *

540
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,526
Jika saya akan melakukan ini,

541
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:54,994
Saya membutuhkan tiga hal:

542
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,697
Pacar, mobil, dan rencana.

543
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,932
Pernikahan berlangsung pada pukul 4: 00.

544
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,868
di perkebunan keluarga Logan di Malibu.

545
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,103
Final langsung berlangsung pada pukul 5: 00.

546
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,605
pada CINTA: Tahap terisi penuh,

547
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:07,674
hanya 2,3 mil di jalan.

548
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,075
Pada saat saya dibutuhkan di lokasi syuting,

549
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,043
resepsi pernikahan akan berjalan lancar.

550
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,378
Saya akan menyelinap pergi untuk mengerjakan final,

551
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,446
dan kembalilah sebelum ada yang menyadari aku pergi.

552
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,782
Ini sangat mudah.

553
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,717
Selanjutnya, saya membutuhkan mobil.

554
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,018
Mobil yang bisa mengemudi sendiri.

555
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,519
Mengamankan kunci itu mudah.

556
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,122
Kelley membiarkan Archer mengambil LUV-6 kapan pun dia mau,

557
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,891
dan dia dengan senang hati menyerahkannya.

558
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,559
Tunggu, kau naik mobil?

559
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,227
Zoey, kembali ke sini!

560
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,196
Apa? Ugh!

561
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,231
* Waktu untuk berjalan *

562
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,666
Ugh, terima kasih Tuhan.

563
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,370
Siswa telah menjadi master.

564
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,007
Sekarang, yang saya butuhkan hanyalah kencan.

565
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,475
Tapi di mana saya seharusnya menemukan seorang jagoan

566
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:46,613
Ahli bedah UGD Australia yang bernama Hugo Hemsworth?

567
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,514
Yo, ada apa? Namaku Dragon.

568
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,982
Nama asli saya adalah Vantarius,

569
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,818
tapi saya penggemar Game of Thrones yang sangat besar,

570
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:54,286
jadi saya secara resmi mengubah nama saya ketika saya berusia 18 tahun.

571
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,991
Ayolah, siapa yang bisa menolak ini?

572
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,595
Namaku Spencer, dan aku tahu apa yang diinginkan wanita.

573
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,698
Dia mungkin tidak ada.

574
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,067
Yang saya butuhkan adalah seorang aktor.

575
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,870
Halo, nama saya Todd E. Schupert.

576
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,171
Umurku 28 tahun.

577
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,539
Saya seorang aktor dari Burbank, California.

578
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,709
Saya juga bisa melakukan aksen. Saya bisa melakukan Australia.

579
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,511
Saya baru saja keluar dari Bondi Beach.

580
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:21,213
G'day, apa kabar?

581
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,282
Dan di situlah Anda masuk.

582
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,051
Melihat r Anda sum,

583
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,153
Saya dapat melihat bahwa Anda memiliki pelatihan bertahun-tahun,

584
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,321
lusinan film mahasiswa di bawah ikat pinggang Anda.

585
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,757
BFA dalam Akting.

586
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,694
Oh, dan anak di bawah umur dalam Perkembangan Anak Usia Dini.

587
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,262
- Keren. - Tidak, tidak, tidak.

588
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:39,498
Saya manny untuk keluarga di samping.

589
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,201
Oke, saya bisa berhenti jika Anda membutuhkannya.

590
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,604
Tidak ada acara TV atau film besar. Itu bagus.

591
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,007
Oke, jadi, maaf, apa hubungannya ini dengan

592
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,977
dengan saya mendapatkan CINTA: Terisi Penuh ?

593
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,312
Todd, aku di sini bukan untuk bicara denganmu

594
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,247
tentang jatuh CINTA: Terisi Penuh.

595
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,285
Saya melihat rekaman kiriman Anda,

596
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,888
dan aku menggunakan kekuatanku untuk membawamu ke sini.

597
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,556
Itu salah, dan saya minta maaf tentang itu.

598
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,559
Oke, jadi mengapa aku di sini?

599
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,961
Aku butuh bantuan.

600
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,531
Saya membutuhkan seseorang untuk memerankan pacar saya

601
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,566
di pernikahan sahabatku akhir pekan depan.

602
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,803
Saya membutuhkan mereka untuk berkomitmen penuh

603
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,505
cara yang hanya bisa dilakukan oleh aktor sungguhan.

604
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:25,912
Oke. Jadi, seperti, metode.

605
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,548
Tentu. Ya.

606
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,353
I...

607
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,188
Saya tidak tahu mengapa saya pikir ini ide yang bagus.

608
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:37,990
Lupakan tanyaku. Maafkan aku.

609
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,526
Tidak, tidak, tidak. Oke, jika saya melakukan ini,

610
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,128
bisakah Anda mengajak saya ke acara itu?

611
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,564
Maksud saya, saya pasti bisa mencoba.

612
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,168
Itu cukup bagus untukku.

613
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,703
* Anda dan saya sudah selesai, meskipun *

614
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,071
* Saksikan aku memukulnya sendirian *

615
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,774
* Saya akan melakukannya secara akapela, ya *

616
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,408
Apakah ini benar-benar gila?

617
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,545
Bagian mana, mempekerjakan aktor super seksi untuk memerankan pacar Anda

618
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,513
di pernikahan sahabat Anda, atau setuju untuk bekerja

619
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,682
akhir pekan yang sama dengan pernikahan sahabatmu?

620
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,084
Bagian pacar.

621
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,753
Meyakinkan teman-teman Anda bahwa Anda memiliki pacar yang seksi

622
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,722
adalah kekhawatiran Anda yang paling kecil jika dia tidak memperhatikan jalan.

623
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,990
Apakah dia tahu apa yang dia lakukan?

624
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,524
Mobil itu mengemudi sendiri,

625
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,094
dan kinerjanya sangat baik selama fase pengujian keamanan.

626
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,429
Itu menabrak enam boneka tabrakan.

627
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,332
Um, halo? Arch?

628
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,402
Aku kehilanganmu mengemudi melewati ngarai.

629
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,603
Pelayanan yang buruk.

630
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,873
Mobil akan kembali sebelum pertunjukan ditayangkan.

631
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,207
Oke, dah!

632
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,110
Ini tombol merahnya, Zoey.

633
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,679
Tombol merah besar. Pusat. Ya, di sana. Akhir--

634
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,484
Uh, apa yang kau baca?

635
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,988
Oh, ada lima langkah untuk menciptakan karakter yang sempurna.

636
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,224
Siapa, apa, kapan, di mana, dan mengapa.

637
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,726
Saya punya empat yang pertama, kan? Jadi siapa:

638
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,862
Hugo Boss Hemsworth.

639
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:53,199
Apa: dia adalah ahli bedah ER yang terkenal

640
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,701
siapa yang jatuh cinta dengan Zoey Brooks.

641
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,169
Kapan: hari ini.

642
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,772
Dimana: lahir di Melbourne.

643
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,707
Dibesarkan di West Philly.

644
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,643
Anda benar-benar mengambil beberapa kebebasan di sana.

645
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,345
Saya tidak bisa menjelaskan alasannya.

646
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,515
Anda tahu, interpretasi saya adalah bahwa dia sedang dimanfaatkan

647
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,251
sebagai alat untuk membuat mantan pacar Anda cemburu.

648
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,685
- Apakah itu benar? - Cemburu?

649
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,754
Tidak, tidak, tidak, sama sekali tidak.

650
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,489
Itu akan menjadi tidak dewasa.

651
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,459
Saya hanya ingin menunjukkan padanya dan semua orang

652
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,963
bahwa saya adalah orang dewasa yang sangat sukses dan berpengetahuan luas

653
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:28,267
siapa yang pindah dan melakukan yang lebih baik darinya.

654
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,501
Dimengerti.

655
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:35,341
J-E-A-lous.

656
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,960
Hai. Oh, terima kasih banyak sudah datang. Dasi yang bagus.

657
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,361
- Terima kasih. - Sampai ketemu di luar sana.

658
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,963
Saya tidak tahu harus berkata apa, Chauncy,

659
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,530
dia hanya tidak cukup cepat.

660
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,067
Bawakan aku bajingan lagi. Tidak, tidak, tidak, bawakan aku dua.

661
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,269
Orang-orang membutuhkan tiram.

662
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,171
Aku melihat pengantin wanitanya.

663
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,741
Hai. Itu dia.

664
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,111
- Aku sudah mencarimu. - Maafkan aku, sayang.

665
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,512
Saya telah memadamkan api ke kiri dan ke kanan.

666
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,047
Bukankah itu gunanya perencana pernikahan?

667
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,449
- Ya, aku memecatnya. - Kamu apa?

668
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,551
Dengar, dia hanya-- Dia tidak menjalankan visinya.

669
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,953
Saya pikir akhir pekan ini seharusnya

670
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,088
santai dan akrab.

671
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,456
250 orang itu akrab, sayang.

672
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,225
Tahukah Anda berapa banyak orang yang tidak saya undang?

673
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,861
- Ini hanya sedikit berlebihan. - Sedikit banyak?

674
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,262
Kami mendapat dua kue seukuran aslinya

675
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,898
dari kedua mempelai untuk diantar.

676
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,732
Ya. Di sana baik-baik saja.

677
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,001
- Wow. - Lihat, Quinn,

678
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,636
ini akhir pekan pernikahan kita, oke?

679
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,205
Kamu bekerja sangat keras,

680
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,307
anda pantas mendapatkan lebih dari sedikit.

681
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,375
Anda pantas mendapatkan yang paling banyak.

682
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,944
Aku hanya ingin memberikannya padamu.

683
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,545
Aku tahu kau tahu.

684
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,181
- Quinn! Logan! - Michael.

685
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,282
Kamu terlihat luar biasa!

686
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,151
- Tidak, tidak, tidak! - Ini kue!

687
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,086
Oh, tunggu, apa? Ini kue?

688
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,487
- Ya. - Sial!

689
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,756
Bisakah seseorang mengeluarkan kue manusia ini dari sini,

690
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,058
sebelum aku meleleh?

691
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,060
- Oh! - Senang bertemu denganmu.

692
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,828
- Aku sangat senang kau ada di sini. - Buddy.

693
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,466
Oh, bung, saya sangat senang bahwa ini akhirnya terjadi.

694
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:09,101
Dua sahabat saya akan menikah?

695
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,037
Mengambil risiko, dan saya bisa menjerumuskannya?

696
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,739
Ini benar-benar suatu kehormatan. Jujur.

697
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,274
Oh, berbicara tentang upacara,

698
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,309
Saya ingin membahas apa yang saya miliki sejauh ini.

699
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,744
Saya mendapat, seperti, lima draf.

700
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,646
Aku sudah menulis, oke?

701
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,214
"Yang terkasih..."

702
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,752
Ini dia, Todd.

703
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,520
Keberatan memanggilku Hugo?

704
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,422
Itu hanya membantu saya tetap berkarakter.

705
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,891
Sekarang tolong, biarkan saya mengambil waktu saya sebelumnya.

706
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,297
Todd.

707
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,134
"Kami berkumpul di sini untuk melewati hal yang disebut kehidupan ini."

708
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,535
Ada apa dengan mobil itu?

709
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,905
- Todd. - Saya tidak kenal siapa pun bernama Todd.

710
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,740
- Mobil itu. Mobilnya! - Oh, Tuhan.

711
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,876
Awas!

712
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,615
Oh!

713
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,719
- Oh, Tuhan! - Pintu terbuka.

714
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:02,854
- Saya pikir itu... - Kau baik-baik saja? Semuanya baik-baik saja?

715
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,431
Ada apa?

716
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,666
Ada apa?

717
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,635
You almost hit us
with your car!

718
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,371
It's called making an entrance,
Logan.

719
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,841
All right. I'll accept that.

720
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,277
That's a pretty good entrance.
I mean, damn!

721
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,114
-What's up, Zoey?
-Michael, it's been too long.

722
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,849
Yeah, no shit, we live in the
same city and we barely see you.

723
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,119
-What's up with that?
-'Cause she's too busy

724
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,553
putting up with my ass.

725
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,022
Apologies for my appearance.

726
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,457
I had to come
straight from surgery.

727
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,092
-Surgery?
-This is Hugo.

728
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,394
-Hugo, this is...
-Quinn and Logan!

729
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,063
The bride and the groom.

730
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,364
Of course I know
who you are.

731
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,166
Zoey's told me so much
about you.

732
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,434
- Love your car.
- Thank you.

733
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,935
And you must be Michael?

734
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,504
Yes. The officiant, Michael.

735
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,073
-Pardon?
-The officiant.

736
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,476
You know, you said their titles,
you know, bride and groom,

737
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,845
but I'm Michael,
the officiant.

738
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,747
-Okay.
-Yeah.

739
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,183
-That's awesome.
-Yeah, it is awesome.

740
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,984
It's an honor, actually.

741
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,619
Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,257
Um, hon, I'm gonna go
put the bags in our room.

743
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,092
Quinn, could you point me
in the right direction?

744
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,394
The wedding party is staying
in the guest quarters upstairs.

745
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,496
Yeah, I'll show them up.
Come on, Michael.

746
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,530
Thanks.

747
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,232
Somebody clean up that glass.

748
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,169
Okay, where did you find him?

749
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,503
He's perfect.

750
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,405
Tell me about it.

751
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,539
So how are things going?

752
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:30,042
Oh, uh... well, you'll see.

753
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,847
Welcome. Welcome, everyone.

754
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,317
Cheers to Logan and Quinn.

755
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,685
Cheers!

756
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,720
I got that second shucker
on site.

757
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,990
All right, I'm taking him
to you now.

758
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,159
I said two trays.

759
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,628
So then I'm thinking
of closing with a joke.

760
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,164
You know, since everyone
will be sobbing at that point.

761
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,965
You gotta wake up.

762
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,334
I'm trying to rehearse here.

763
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,536
What a disgusting
display of wealth.

764
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,405
God, I hate rich people.

765
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,640
Uh, don't you live here?

766
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,045
It's journalism.
The case I'm working on now

767
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,380
is a real stumper.

768
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,350
They call him
the Malibu Murderer.

769
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,684
He's still at large.

770
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,687
-So you're a detective?
-Podcast host.

771
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,822
Logan! Quinn!

772
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:21,427
Oh, look, I'm so glad
you wore makeup

773
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,594
Bubbe, that's a cake.

774
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,665
-That's a cake?
-Yeah. Come on. Come on.

775
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,868
Don't talk to that.

776
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,804
I see. This is big,
even for Logan.

777
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,074
Yeah, I don't even know
half these people here.

778
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,409
Well, you know me,

779
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,378
and I'm here for anything at all
that you need,

780
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,547
whether it's a refill
or a rescue.

781
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,315
Hey, babe?
I really need you right now.

782
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:44,850
Aunt Carol and her bridge club
want a photo.

783
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,119
-Okay, I'll rescue you.
-Like, now.

784
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,954
Save you in a bit.

785
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:54,226
Sleeping arrangements
aren't gonna be a problem.

786
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,762
The rooms are huge.

787
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:01,099
I situated myself on the couch
like a gentleman.

788
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,068
And didn't think to change.

789
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:08,507
Zoey, I'm creating a character,
okay?

790
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,741
-Mm-hmm.
-I just...

791
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,977
I need you to trust the work.

792
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,981
Now, which one is the ex?

793
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,883
I don't think he's here yet.

794
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,019
Okay, good, I'm gonna go
get us some drinks.

795
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,717
Oh!

796
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,186
Chase.

797
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,521
Here.

798
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,592
Uh...

799
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:02,528
Hi.

800
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,463
Hi.

801
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,997
Hi!

802
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,533
Oh, um...

803
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,536
this is my girlfriend,
Danielle.

804
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,604
-Hi.
-So excited to be here.

805
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,105
It's like a dream,
meeting everyone

806
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,141
Chase keeps talking about
from high school.

807
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,343
Nice to meet you. I'm--

808
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,211
Ah. Let me guess.

809
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,746
Dana.

810
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,047
Lola?

811
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,882
-Coco?
-Zoey. I'm Zoey.

812
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,585
Chase, I don't remember you
mentioning a Zoey.

813
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,154
Yeah, well, must have
slipped my mind.

814
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,722
Ah, sorry.

815
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,725
Vodka martini,
slightly dirty.

816
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,961
Mm, just like you, cowgirl.

817
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,998
Hi, I'm Hugo Hemsworth,
Zoey's boyf.

818
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:43,168
Oh! Boyf.
Wow, that's a strong grip.

819
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,936
-And jawline.
-Thank you.

820
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,039
I... am Chase.
Chase.

821
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,808
Danielle.

822
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,410
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

823
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,580
-Hang on one second.
-Yes, babe, sure.

824
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,485
Um, I have to take this.

825
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:01,820
-So nice to meet you, Danielle.
-Likewise.

826
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,622
Chase, I had something
I wanted to tell you,

827
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,091
but must have slipped my mind.
See you.

828
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,226
See you, sexy.

829
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,928
You'll have to excuse
the scrubs.

830
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,897
I had to come straight
from surgery.

831
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,632
-Surgery?
-Wow.

832
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:14,833
We pulled a double.

833
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,902
Heart and brain
at the same time.

834
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,437
That's amazing.

835
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:22,474
* Well, good for you *

836
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,209
* I guess you moved on
really easily *

837
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,945
* Found a new girl, and it only
took a couple weeks *

838
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:31,116
* Remember when you said you
wanted to give me the world? *

839
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,818
* World *

840
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,286
* And good for you *

841
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:35,987
* I guess that you've been
working on yourself *

842
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,556
* I guess that therapist
I found for you *

843
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,624
* She really helped *

844
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,459
* Now you can be a better man *

845
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,728
* For your brand-new girl *

846
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,463
Sorry, I was getting
the car detailed.

847
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:45,964
-Please!
-Oh, the shoes.

848
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,766
Then take them off.
Take them off.

849
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:48,967
-Greg.
-Okay, here.

850
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,502
Leave her shoes--
Leave them there!

851
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,637
Okay.

852
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,305
Oh, sorry. Okay, okay.

853
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,941
Perhaps you'd care
to explain...

854
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,610
this.

855
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,779
The thing I love most
about Jordyn J.

856
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,115
is probably her boobs.

857
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,185
Oh, my God. The hair...

858
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,022
looks so...

859
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:13,392
good.

860
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:15,461
So you knew about this

861
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,728
and you let it happen?

862
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,765
Because the hair?
That was it.

863
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,333
That was all that he had.

864
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,701
That's exactly why.

865
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,737
He wanted to show Jordyn J.
and America

866
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,374
that he's more
than just his hair.

867
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,141
Uh, he's a trendsetter.

868
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,943
It's called strategy.

869
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,178
Is it?

870
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:37,616
Kelley, being your first
and only female producer,

871
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,351
you just got to trust me
on this.

872
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:42,588
I know what our audience wants
because I am our audience.

873
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,992
And I love the hair.

874
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,496
For your own sake,

875
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:53,599
I hope that you are right.

876
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,867
Okay.

877
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,869
Zoey?

878
00:38:58,404 --> 00:38:59,671
Seriously.

879
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:01,272
Hot dress.

880
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,741
- Oh.
- Yeah.

881
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,643
Now I take you seriously.

882
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:06,845
Okay. Thanks.

883
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,179
Greg!

884
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,582
Punch you in the face.

885
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,219
Just pumping away,
trying to get a pulse.

886
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,822
Seven-year-old kid
swallowed a ping-pong ball.

887
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,492
-So sad.
-Oh, my God.

888
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,660
No, no, no. Don't worry.

889
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,061
He is fine.

890
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,298
Nobody has ever died
on my table.

891
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,333
Aw!

892
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,201
Except maybe a couple times.

893
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,539
Who even is this guy?

894
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,774
Shh. He's so sweet.

895
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,643
You know what?
Enough about me.

896
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:40,546
Stacey, I'm a huge fan
of the pod.

897
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,813
Total Slaughter-head.

898
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,415
- Oh!
- Yeah.

899
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,451
Any updates
on the Malibu Murderer?

900
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,420
Oh. Um... you listen?

901
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,755
Ahem. I'm back.

902
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,691
This is Mark, my field producer.

903
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:53,959
-Husband.
-Uh-huh.

904
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,827
But, yes, also field producer.

905
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,262
Didn't you and Quinn
used to...?

906
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,797
Date. Yes.

907
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,599
Yeah, it was just a fling.

908
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,100
But this, uh...

909
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,570
-This is the real deal.
-Excuse me.

910
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,004
How was it with the witness?

911
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,406
-I got a description...
-Yes, Mark. Great work.

912
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,541
...of his hands.

913
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,009
Damn it, Mark,
that's not enough.

914
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,943
But go on.

915
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,746
She said the hands
were large.

916
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,549
That's it?

917
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,050
Not guilty!

918
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,188
- They're enormous.
- Oh, so funny!

919
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:26,257
Jordan B.,
why is your hair orange?

920
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,426
I thought I could fix it
without anyone noticing.

921
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,128
Fix what?

922
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,099
I found a gray hair, okay?

923
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,400
You happy?

924
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,836
I can't have gray hair at 23.
I'm supposed to be hot.

925
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,105
You bleached your whole head
because of one gray hair?

926
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,173
Then it kind of started
falling out, so I had to cut it.

927
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,510
I tried to find you first,
but you weren't here.

928
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,944
I'm sorry. I know.

929
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,946
It's just...

930
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,482
Hang on. One second.

931
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,085
Um...

932
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,788
-I'm gonna have to leave again.
-What?

933
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,491
If you need anything at all,
you call me.

934
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,760
Not Kelley, okay? Me.

935
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,394
You're gonna be fine.

936
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:08,934
What was I saying?

937
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,468
Oh, yeah. Jordyn's boobs.

938
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,246
Om...

939
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,480
* Cha cha *

940
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,184
* Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da *

941
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,855
* If you wanna have some fun *

942
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,857
* Come with me
I'll give you some *

943
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,759
* Get back, get back *

944
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,862
So, in a way,
I credit Zoey

945
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,630
for saving
that little boy's life.

946
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,398
- Aw!
- Yeah, she...

947
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,701
- So sweet.
- Oh, my God.

948
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,570
She inspires me
to be a better surgeon.

949
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,138
- Aw!
- Wow.

950
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,575
Can you take a look at my feet?
Because--

951
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,477
-Whoa!
-What is that?!

952
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:53,879
I'm sorry, it stinks.

953
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,647
Don't smell it. Just fix it.

954
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,148
Quinn?

955
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,484
Quinn?

956
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,924
- Jordan B., what do you want?
- Zoey.

957
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:08,827
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

958
00:42:09,795 --> 00:42:11,162
It's gonna--
It's gonna be okay.

959
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,866
No! A neck tattoo will not fix
what you did to your hair.

960
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,935
Who's getting a neck tattoo?

961
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:19,905
I-I have to go.

962
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,041
Quinn, I've been looking
all over for you.

963
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,376
What are you doing
in the bathtub?

964
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:26,978
I'm unclogging the drain.

965
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,347
Did you know clogged drains can
lead to corrosion and flooding?

966
00:42:29,815 --> 00:42:30,916
Oh no.

967
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,852
Okay, what's wrong?

968
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,690
I never dreamed
of having a wedding.

969
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:41,827
But then I fell in love
with someone who did.

970
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,064
And I want to do this for him,
but it's all a lot.

971
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,299
Does Logan know that?

972
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,869
We've been together
over a decade. You'd think so.

973
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,771
But he's so totally absorbed,

974
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,239
it's like
he's a different person.

975
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,642
I know he's dreamed of having
an extravagant wedding,

976
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,409
and I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

977
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,747
But I'm not a rational function.
My limits are not infinite.

978
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:03,581
If only humans
could have vertical asymptotes,

979
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:04,916
you know what I'm saying?

980
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,119
Not at all.

981
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,588
But I think I get
the gist of it.

982
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,424
So why don't we just
get out of here.

983
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,426
Leave my own party?

984
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,195
I don't think I'm allowed
to do that.

985
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,564
You're the bride.
You can do whatever you want.

986
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,033
Party's almost over.

987
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,201
Plus, there's a cake down there

988
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,036
that everyone thinks
is you anyway.

989
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,141
-Where would we even go?
-I have ideas.

990
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,410
Seriously?

991
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,745
A karaoke bar?

992
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,947
No, no, no, no. It's late.

993
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,749
The rehearsal's tomorrow.

994
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:40,185
- We gotta be rested.
- Hey!

995
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:41,920
Look at me.

996
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,388
I love you.

997
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,891
I love you too.

998
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,993
So stop thinking about
the wedding for one second

999
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:50,428
and have some fun with me,
okay?

1000
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,799
Fine.

1001
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:55,300
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah!

1002
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,568
But if Michael doesn't sing
Limp Bizkit, I'm leaving.

1003
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,338
Cool. Everyone's drinks
are on Logan. Let's go inside.

1004
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,607
Let's go. Come on, babe.

1005
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,475
- That's it, Logan.
- Let's do this.

1006
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,111
-You good?
-I'm good. You good?

1007
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,578
-Yeah. Great.
-Good.

1008
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:15,486
* Chocolate stardust *

1009
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,624
* Keep on rolling, baby *

1010
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,927
* Throw your hands up *

1011
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,429
* Now move in, now move out,
hands up, now hands down *

1012
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:27,265
* Back up, back up,
tell me what you gonna do now *

1013
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,667
* Breathe in, now breathe out,
hands up, now hands down *

1014
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:32,203
* Back up, back up,
tell me what you gonna do now *

1015
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,472
* Keep rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin' *

1016
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:37,075
* Keep rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin' *

1017
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,610
* Keep rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin' *

1018
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:40,879
* Keep rollin'... *

1019
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,281
Yeah! This is my favorite!
Rollin', rollin'!

1020
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,816
* I know y'all be lovin
this ish right here *

1021
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,485
* L-I-M-P Bizkit
is right here *

1022
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,620
* Gonna F you up,
shut the F up *

1023
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:53,391
* And back the F up
while we F this track up *

1024
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,130
* You wanna mess
with Limp Bizkit? *

1025
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,665
* You can't mess
with Limp Bizkit *

1026
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,934
* 'Cause we get it on
every day and every night *

1027
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,635
Was he always that talented?

1028
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:08,539
Yeah, but in school
it was mostly sad flute music.

1029
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,941
Oh, yes!

1030
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,778
So you all went
to high school together?

1031
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,479
Yeah! PCA, baby!

1032
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,481
So sad what happened.

1033
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:20,852
We were the last class
to attend Pacific Coast Academy.

1034
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,855
The school closed down in 2009

1035
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:27,525
when multiple parents complained
about poor education standards,

1036
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,295
leading the state to launch
a formal investigation,

1037
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,198
only to discover the school
wasn't even accredited

1038
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,633
and Dean Rivers was stealing
students' tuition

1039
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,236
and blowing it
at Morongo Casino and Resort.

1040
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,605
Yeah, it wasn't even
a real school.

1041
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:43,174
The student loans were real! Ha!

1042
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,710
I have so much debt!

1043
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,915
* Keep rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin' *

1044
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:51,582
* Rollin' *

1045
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,451
Woo!

1046
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:57,322
-Let's go!
-Great job, buddy. Great job.

1047
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,657
- Let's do it.
- That was awesome!

1048
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:04,830
I'm gonna hit the head.
Does anybody need anything?

1049
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,232
Chase? Maybe a water?

1050
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:08,900
Yes.

1051
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,601
All right, I'll be right back.

1052
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:13,504
-Consent to a kiss?
-Granted.

1053
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,916
All right, next up,
we have Hugo Hemsworth

1054
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:27,618
and Chase Matthews

1055
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,786
singing a duet.

1056
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,455
No, I'm all set.

1057
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,925
Babe, you love karaoke. Go!

1058
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:40,298
Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase!

1059
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,067
-Yes!
-Woo!

1060
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,568
Yes, Chase!

1061
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:44,569
Go, Chase, go!

1062
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:45,871
Hope you're cool
with the high part.

1063
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:46,938
Uh, what song are we even--

1064
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:50,675
* Now I've had *

1065
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,244
* The time of my life *

1066
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,347
* No, I never felt
like this before *

1067
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,216
Damn it, I love this song.

1068
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,985
* Yes, I swear *

1069
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:02,087
* It's the truth *

1070
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:04,956
* And I owe it all to you *

1071
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:08,459
* 'Cause I've had *

1072
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,096
* The time of my life *

1073
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:14,933
* And I owe it all to you *

1074
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,302
-Yo, they're both...
-Pretty good!

1075
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:19,037
-Yeah.
-Let's go, Chase!

1076
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:20,471
Not bad.

1077
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:22,473
Bet you didn't know
I was a high tenor, did you?

1078
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,442
* I've been waiting
for so long *

1079
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,078
* Now I finally
found someone *

1080
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,547
* To stand by me *

1081
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,618
* We saw the writing
on the wall *

1082
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:37,889
* As we felt
this magical fantasy *

1083
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,393
* Now with passion
in our eyes *

1084
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:46,631
* There's no way
we could disguise it secretly *

1085
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:50,902
* So we take
each others' hand *

1086
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:56,474
* 'Cause we seem to understand
the urgency *

1087
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:05,816
-Are they...?
-Wasted?

1088
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,518
One of them is.

1089
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:10,388
* I've had *

1090
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,690
* The time of my life *

1091
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,162
* No, I never felt
this way before *

1092
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:19,364
* Yes, I swear *

1093
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,200
* It's the truth *

1094
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,437
* And I owe it all to you *

1095
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:29,374
See that bod?

1096
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,113
Yes!

1097
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,481
Calm down.

1098
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,196
Yes!

1099
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,766
I can't dance like that.
I can't dance like that.

1100
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,935
No, come on! Come on!

1101
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,704
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Are you okay?

1102
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,172
I am so sorry, dude.

1103
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:02,507
What is this?

1104
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,175
What? I thought we were
just having fun.

1105
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,710
This is about Zoey, isn't it?

1106
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,878
You're mad we dated so you're
trying to make me jealous.

1107
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,248
Well, that's not gonna work,
Mr. Sexy Doctor Man,

1108
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,250
because I don't care
about Zoey anymore.

1109
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,585
-What's happening?
-Looks like they're fighting.

1110
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,556
Let's just chill out.

1111
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,958
That's it. I'm over it!
I'm over her!

1112
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,795
-Well, doesn't sound like it.
-What'd you say?

1113
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,431
I just get the feeling

1114
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:29,234
that maybe you're not
actually over her.

1115
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:43,281
You're getting a bit heavy.

1116
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:46,484
Ah!

1117
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,888
- What?
- Up! Up!

1118
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,190
What is your problem?

1119
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,293
Oh, boo-hoo! Time for rehearsal!

1120
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,761
Out of bed!

1121
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,032
Everybody outside in ten!

1122
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,234
What is the matter with you?

1123
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:12,610
Can't he leave me alone
for one minute?

1124
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,312
I'm so sick
of babysitting this guy.

1125
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:15,846
I cannot do this today.

1126
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,054
-Todd.
-Hmm?

1127
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,522
Aren't you a manny?

1128
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:27,458
It's a side gig, but yeah.

1129
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,761
-Hmm?
-No!

1130
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:36,467
No. I'm your fake boyfriend.

1131
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,170
Fake hungover boyfriend.

1132
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,871
I'm not your babysitter.

1133
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,440
Please. Please.

1134
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,041
Meet me in the chapel in ten!

1135
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,844
I have to go be with my friends.
I really need your help on this.

1136
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:47,912
Please.

1137
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,514
The villa is just
right up the street.

1138
00:50:49,614 --> 00:50:51,882
You can go up there,
distract him, have fun.

1139
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,019
-Please, please, please?
-Wait, so I get to go to set?

1140
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,854
Yes. Thank you.

1141
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,626
Oh, my God. Finally.

1142
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,395
Places! Okay.

1143
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,331
So we're gonna start
with Michael

1144
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:09,367
making an announcement
to ask all the guests

1145
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,769
to silence their phones.

1146
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:13,604
Cue Michael.

1147
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,579
Cue Michael.

1148
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,182
Silence your phone.

1149
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:25,450
Bro, what is going on?

1150
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,752
"I think I lost my voice."

1151
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:30,087
How do you know
what he's saying?

1152
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:31,922
I'm really good at lip-reading.

1153
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,224
From over there?

1154
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,792
- Plus, I have 20/20 vision.
- Great.

1155
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,495
So my officiant
has lost his voice

1156
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,497
the day before the wedding!

1157
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,333
This is why we can't have fun.

1158
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,835
"Let me show you. Ready?"

1159
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,538
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

1160
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:50,107
to celebrate this thing
called patriarchy.

1161
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:52,577
Heard of it?

1162
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,313
Which has been used
for centuries to oppress women

1163
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,881
by buying and selling them.

1164
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,417
It's also kept the majority of
wealth in the male minority.

1165
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:00,851
Okay, thank you, Lyric.

1166
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,788
Look, I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta replace you.

1167
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,856
- "Son of a--"
- Fine.

1168
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,925
-I'll do it.
-What?

1169
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:11,562
I have the number one
murder podcast in the U.S.

1170
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,398
People would literally kill

1171
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:14,965
to have me officiate
their wedding.

1172
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,601
Yeah, you make a fair point.

1173
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,002
But who's gonna
walk me down the aisle?

1174
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:21,239
-It's a straight line, babe.
-Michael, obviously.

1175
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,308
"Okay, sounds good."

1176
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,742
Let's try this again.

1177
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:28,513
Stacey will ask everyone
to silence their phones.

1178
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,315
Get out of here, buddy.

1179
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:32,683
Cue Stacey.

1180
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:37,722
Silence your phones!

1181
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,791
Just a little less creepy
next time, okay?

1182
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,461
Yeah, okay.
Lyric's gonna sing us in.

1183
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:46,964
Lyric!

1184
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:58,175
My AI gloves weren't programmed
to deal with that reverb.

1185
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,610
Did you hear the echo?

1186
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:03,514
All right, guys, get in places.

1187
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,816
Michael, Mark,
Camille and Jared, come on.

1188
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,485
-Tighten up.
-How's your nose?

1189
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,886
How do you think?

1190
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,356
Your boyfriend dropped me
on my face on purpose.

1191
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,358
He did not do it on purpose.

1192
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:16,193
Zoey, he's very strong.
His muscles are huge.

1193
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:17,528
He definitely
could have held me.

1194
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:20,097
Classic Chase.
Taking everything so personally.

1195
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,832
He said he was sorry.

1196
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,169
All right,
cue Camille and Jared.

1197
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:27,738
Chase, I know it's awkward,
but for the sake of our friends,

1198
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,907
can't we at least just try
to be friends?

1199
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,743
I'm sorry, but after
everything that happened,

1200
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,445
did you really think
we were gonna be able

1201
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,080
to just link arms
and stroll off into the sunset?

1202
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,216
All right, now Zoey and Chase
will link arms and stroll.

1203
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,085
Okay, the timing of that
was unfair.

1204
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:44,121
They're linking.
They're strolling.

1205
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,758
You could look happy.

1206
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,094
Okay, cue the bride.

1207
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:53,831
And, frankly, there is
no amount of philanthropy

1208
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,533
that will ever make up
for those mistakes.

1209
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:57,402
Lastly,

1210
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:58,936
Quinn, you have come up

1211
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,572
with so many wonderful
inventions over the years,

1212
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,608
but I think
that your most impressive yet

1213
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,876
is actually the reinvention

1214
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:08,112
of this guy right here,
my best friend.

1215
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,515
He's become an amazing man
because of you.

1216
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,883
And so I think I speak
for all of us

1217
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,520
when I say thank you very much,
Quinn.

1218
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,788
To Quinn and Logan. Everyone.

1219
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,857
To Quinn and Logan!

1220
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,596
This is nice.
Stace, isn't this nice?

1221
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,197
Everyone together,
celebrating?

1222
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:30,968
Mm-hmm. Mark, tell me something.
You're my field producer, right?

1223
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:32,269
And husband.

1224
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,505
Then why aren't you
in the field?

1225
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,607
I thought we'd take
the night off.

1226
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,509
Can the women
who are being murdered

1227
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,977
take the night off, Mark?

1228
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:41,111
But...

1229
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,280
couldn't he be here?

1230
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,149
-What?
-I'm just saying,

1231
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,385
technically couldn't
the Malibu Murderer

1232
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,253
be at this wedding

1233
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:50,755
in Malibu?

1234
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,458
How dare you, Mark?

1235
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:55,292
These are our closest
and dearest friends.

1236
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:57,762
-You're so right.
-Why would there be a murderer

1237
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,597
-at this wedding?
-Just forget I said it.

1238
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:00,998
Enjoy your fish.

1239
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:06,303
-Where's Hugo?
-Oh.

1240
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:07,705
Um, uh...

1241
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:10,207
he got called in
for an emergency.

1242
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,377
If only there were more
people like him in the world.

1243
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,813
Hey, Zoe, your turn.
Like yesterday.

1244
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,648
Oh, right. Yeah, okay.

1245
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,253
I would like to make a toast.

1246
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:28,626
I've known Quinn and Logan
for more than half my life.

1247
00:55:29,193 --> 00:55:31,962
During that time,
I've watched Quinn grow,

1248
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:36,501
evolve, and accomplish
almost all of her dreams.

1249
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,103
And I've watched Logan
watch her do that.

1250
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:45,109
Everyone says that high school
love doesn't last,

1251
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:46,977
and they're right.

1252
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,847
Most of the time, it doesn't.

1253
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,717
Against all odds,

1254
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,252
Quinn and Logan
have proved them wrong.

1255
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,289
Uh... um...

1256
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,093
uh, that's why it's so real

1257
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,463
and inspiring.

1258
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,798
Just really makes me,

1259
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:11,436
you know, just dance a little
and, um...

1260
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,672
...just really gets me

1261
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:18,208
so excited, I just want
to sing and drink a lot.

1262
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,844
Yeah!

1263
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:22,012
To Quinn and Logan!

1264
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:29,654
I'm such a klutz.
I'm gonna have to go change.

1265
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,188
You missed your mouth
by a lot.

1266
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,190
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back, okay?

1267
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,628
What is going on?

1268
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,764
Why is he here?
And what is on his face?

1269
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,767
I'm an ice tiger. Grr!

1270
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:44,735
Todd, what happened?

1271
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,504
You told me to babysit.

1272
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:47,938
So I took him to the pier.

1273
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:50,441
He wanted to ride
the kiddy coaster, right?

1274
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,410
But he's too big, so he hit
his head on the support beam.

1275
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,148
Now he can't remember
the last six months of his life.

1276
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,586
Including the show,
or Jordyn J.

1277
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:03,420
What?

1278
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,389
My God.

1279
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,791
Did I just hear a lion?

1280
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:10,060
No. My dad made me get rid
of all my exotic pets.

1281
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,262
It's not that big of a deal.

1282
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,698
Right? It's okay.

1283
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:16,901
I mean, wasn't Jordan B.
pretty stupid already?

1284
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,872
You're right, maybe nobody
will even notice.

1285
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,308
I mean, I'm gonna be telling him
exactly what to say.

1286
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,644
Okay, I need to get back
down there.

1287
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,178
So you're gonna sneak him
into the villa,

1288
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,747
put him to sleep,
he'll sleep this off,

1289
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:31,982
and everything will be--

1290
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:33,317
Oh.

1291
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,743
Door opening.

1292
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:05,950
Door closing.

1293
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,320
Zoey, it is show day.

1294
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,389
You said you were gonna
have the car back in time,

1295
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,958
so where's the car, babe?

1296
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,125
Archer, I promise you,

1297
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,061
the car is the least
of your worries.

1298
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:20,865
Have you seen Jordan B. today?
Is he acting a little,

1299
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:23,000
um, I don't know, different?

1300
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,770
Oh, hey!

1301
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,105
-Hi.
-Hey!

1302
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:29,339
Whoa!

1303
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,680
Just as dumb as usual. Why?

1304
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,348
No reason! Look, I'm on my way
with the car.

1305
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,351
I just have to make a little
pit stop in Santa Barbara.

1306
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,254
Santa Barbara?
That is not on the way.

1307
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,190
Okay, um...

1308
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,259
What do I do?

1309
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,564
No.

1310
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:55,265
Door opening.

1311
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,501
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry! I did not mean to!

1312
00:58:57,602 --> 00:58:59,203
Oh, Chase.

1313
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,571
It's you.

1314
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,072
Zoey!

1315
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,175
If my nose wasn't broken before,
I think it might be now.

1316
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,944
Why are you even up this early?

1317
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,779
I went on a run.
Why are you even up right now?

1318
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,414
Is your nose bleeding?

1319
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,782
Oh, here, I have some tissues.

1320
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,117
Door closing.

1321
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,652
-Uh, no...
-Wait, no, no, no!

1322
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,587
Wait, wait!

1323
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:18,288
Navigation calculated.

1324
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,592
Estimated time:
one hour, 12 minutes.

1325
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,494
Zoey? Turn it off.

1326
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,063
I don't know how.

1327
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,332
You don't know
how to work your own car?

1328
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:30,434
-Come on.
-Turn off!

1329
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,237
- Door. Stop car.
- Uh...

1330
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,140
Cancel trip.

1331
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,176
New drive time:
one hour, 59 minutes.

1332
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,111
Why did it just go up?

1333
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,513
-Quinn?
-Here comes the bride.

1334
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:47,618
All dressed in really pretty
pink pajamas. Hello?

1335
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:49,754
-Wedding day!
-Good morning!

1336
00:59:49,854 --> 00:59:53,090
-You all look so good!
-You do!

1337
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:55,860
Where's Zoey?

1338
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,561
-Oh.
-Zoey?

1339
00:59:57,662 --> 00:59:58,696
Zoey?

1340
00:59:58,796 --> 01:00:00,931
-Zoe?
-Zoey?

1341
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,633
-Zoey?
-Zoey?

1342
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,578
It's showtime, baby.

1343
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,289
Can you at least tell me
where we're going?

1344
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,031
Cool, I guess we'll just
sit in silence then.

1345
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:36,633
Chase, you made it very clear

1346
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,669
that you don't want to hear
what I have to say.

1347
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:40,170
I thought that maybe
this weekend,

1348
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,106
we could put our past
behind us and act like adults,

1349
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:43,841
but clearly we cannot.

1350
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,811
So, yes, I think it's best
if we don't speak.

1351
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:48,679
Playing "Don't Speak."

1352
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:51,782
* You and me *

1353
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:55,619
* We used to be together *

1354
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,655
* Every day, together *

1355
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:01,091
* Always *

1356
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,062
* I really feel *

1357
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:08,098
* That I'm losing
my best friend *

1358
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:13,370
* I can't believe
this could be the end *

1359
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,405
* Don't speak *

1360
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,208
* I know just what
you're saying *

1361
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:21,278
* So please stop explaining *

1362
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,280
* Don't tell me,
'cause it hurts *

1363
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,282
Ladies, are we decent?

1364
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,585
Hugo, what are you
doing here?

1365
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,620
Zoey's dealing with a little
work emergency,

1366
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,857
-so she sent me.
-Wow.

1367
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:35,259
Who wants mimosas?

1368
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,493
Yes!

1369
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,863
-Everybody take a glass.
-Is everything okay?

1370
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:40,831
Here you go.
Everything is fine.

1371
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,633
-She's gonna be right back.
-Okay.

1372
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,205
Arriving
at Perry's Fine Jewelry.

1373
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,611
But Logan said
you got the rings already.

1374
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,746
Doors opening.

1375
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,782
Thank God.
Let's get out of here.

1376
01:01:57,882 --> 01:02:00,117
This thing's horrible.
It's like a prison on wheels.

1377
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,220
Doors closing.
Self-park activating.

1378
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,023
Oh. Heh.

1379
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,527
Hey, is that the car
from LOVE: Fully Charged ?

1380
01:02:11,295 --> 01:02:12,062
No.

1381
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,663
I'm pretty sure it is.

1382
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,032
No, it's not.

1383
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,040
These are really nice.

1384
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,475
Even I would like for you
to buy me some of these.

1385
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,511
You know, if you want
somebody on the side,

1386
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:28,779
I am that person.

1387
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,718
We are appointment only.

1388
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:35,820
You have an appointment?

1389
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,822
Um, we're here to pick up.

1390
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,490
-Name?
-Reese. Logan and Quinn.

1391
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,860
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Reese.

1392
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,662
Stop playing with me. You know
you got no money. Go home.

1393
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:50,034
Oh! Mr. and Mrs. Reese,
I did not recognize your voice.

1394
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,768
I spoke to y'all over the phone.

1395
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,237
Remember me? Janice.

1396
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:54,771
-No, that's actually not...
-No. We're not...

1397
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:57,141
Honestly, it's fine.
My mama say I'm forgettable.

1398
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,876
But you two are late.

1399
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:00,210
I thought maybe
you was trying to ditch us

1400
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:01,979
and get your rings
down the street.

1401
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,915
Pauline! Kayla!

1402
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:07,084
-The Reese family is here!
-Oh, my God.

1403
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,654
The rings will be right out.

1404
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:11,721
-Oh!
-Oh!

1405
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,691
Pauline! Kayla!

1406
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:26,436
Oh, this is a lot.

1407
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,773
-Uh, no.
-Uh, no. We're fine.

1408
01:03:29,874 --> 01:03:31,775
- Take it.
- Take it.

1409
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,111
Okay.

1410
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,113
We love giving high-paying
customers like yourself

1411
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:37,314
the full VIP treatment.

1412
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:38,648
We hope you don't mind.

1413
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,450
-We actually have to go.
-Yeah, we need to leave.

1414
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,988
Oh, come on, you're never gonna
be as in love as you are now.

1415
01:03:44,088 --> 01:03:45,622
And it might not even last.

1416
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,058
-Probably won't.
-That's a weird thing to say.

1417
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,359
Okay. Oh!

1418
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,295
A toast to the bride and groom.

1419
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,030
Cheers!

1420
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,831
So, Quinn and Logan,
what's your story?

1421
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:57,101
-Again, we're actually not...
-We don't want to...

1422
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:00,304
Oh, come on, don't be
those people, so boring.

1423
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,306
Don't even think
about being those people.

1424
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,575
You're not gonna get these rings
until you spill the tea.

1425
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,177
Now, where did you meet?

1426
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,047
Well, we met in middle school.

1427
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:12,516
Oh, young love. I love.
Then what?

1428
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,819
He saw me and ran his bike
into a flagpole.

1429
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,321
-No. A flagpole?
-I'm dead.

1430
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,656
-Then we became best friends.
-Study buddies.

1431
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,558
But everybody knew
I had a thing for her.

1432
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,293
And no one knew
I had a thing for him.

1433
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,828
-They knew.
-They did not.

1434
01:04:24,929 --> 01:04:26,964
But every time I tried
to take it to the next level,

1435
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:29,366
something always got in the way.

1436
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,768
Other boyfriends.

1437
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,071
-Other girlfriends.
-Yikes. We don't like that.

1438
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,739
-Distance.
-Mm-hmm.

1439
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,274
-Mistakes.
-Ugh.

1440
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,009
But anyway, here we are
getting married now.

1441
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,677
It's great,
so fast-forward to now.

1442
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:41,578
We'd love our rings.

1443
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,147
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

1444
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,849
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

1445
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:48,552
-Actually, we're just gonna...
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1446
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:50,820
-We're just gonna...
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1447
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:55,392
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1448
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:57,661
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1449
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,599
Guys, seriously?

1450
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,969
-We're actually gonna head.
-We should leave, right?

1451
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,736
This is a lot.
And the champagne was...

1452
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,706
* I'm just waiting
for your love *

1453
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:12,209
* You know you are
the only one *

1454
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,643
* That I think of *

1455
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,147
* And all I want to do
is fuel the fire *

1456
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,648
Oh.

1457
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:21,618
-Seriously, these suck.
-Every single one.

1458
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:23,020
Blurry.

1459
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,256
No, actually,
Zoey's the big spoon

1460
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:27,757
and I'm the little spoon.

1461
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,026
We're cute like that.

1462
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,928
Hugo, you are hilarious.

1463
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:33,297
Where did you grow up again?

1464
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,564
Burbank.

1465
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,266
Uh... Brisbane.

1466
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:40,904
Australia. Brisbane.

1467
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,675
Sometimes I use an
Australian accent when I go out.

1468
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,611
You wouldn't believe

1469
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:51,748
how many men, women,
and nonbinary people I get

1470
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:53,217
when I use this voice.

1471
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,585
Hey, Hugo, could you text
Zoey for me?

1472
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,821
I've tried a bunch of times,
but she hasn't responded.

1473
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,323
Yeah, can do.

1474
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:01,725
I'll get us a bottle
while I'm out.

1475
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:07,564
All right, see you soon.

1476
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,700
Ugh. Aussies are the best.

1477
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:14,471
Hey, Logan, here's an idea.

1478
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,306
I can still officiate
the wedding

1479
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,907
using text to voice.

1480
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:19,809
What? No, dude.
Absolutely not.

1481
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,146
Look, I can't find Chase
anywhere. Where is he?

1482
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:26,050
Dude, I can't hear
a single thing you're saying.

1483
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,117
Where is he?

1484
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:28,718
-I'll text him.
-I'll text him.

1485
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,886
Thank you, Jared.

1486
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,324
Jared, you suck.

1487
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,093
Really, Michael?

1488
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,265
Is that what happens
when you get engaged?

1489
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,866
Free champagne
everywhere you go?

1490
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:44,401
No, that's what happens
when you drop

1491
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,670
six figures on a ring.

1492
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,039
So, um, you think you and Hugo
will get engaged?

1493
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:50,740
No.

1494
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,909
I'm-I'm-- I mean, no.

1495
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,845
Not really thinking
about marriage.

1496
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,714
But what about you?

1497
01:06:57,814 --> 01:06:59,849
Danielle? No.
I mean, she's great.

1498
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,785
Um, for now.

1499
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:04,321
Uh, you know,
the timing just felt right.

1500
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,856
Timing. Something we never had.

1501
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:16,900
I'm so sorry about Hawaii.

1502
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,369
I tried to call.
I sent messages.

1503
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,538
And I completely understand
why you didn't respond,

1504
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,141
but I wanted the chance
to explain why I--

1505
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:27,043
Left me alone on a literal
island and waited weeks to call?

1506
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,778
Yeah, why did you do that?

1507
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:35,319
I guess I was so used to it
not working out between us

1508
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:38,555
that I was scared
of what would happen

1509
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:42,025
if it actually did.
So I just bailed.

1510
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:46,096
I really, really wish I hadn't.

1511
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:50,167
I mean, I've tried to move on.
I've tried to forget.

1512
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:51,868
I threw myself into work.

1513
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:54,371
Distanced myself
from all of our friends.

1514
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,706
I even downloaded
every dating app on Earth.

1515
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,676
But no matter what I did,
it always came back to you.

1516
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:05,382
I know that sounds
so ridiculous, but it's why...

1517
01:08:35,879 --> 01:08:37,814
Why is the car stopping?

1518
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,884
Zero percent charge.

1519
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:44,720
Oh, my gosh.
You have to charge this car.

1520
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,656
Yeah, that's kind of a thing.

1521
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,997
You look beautiful.

1522
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:56,966
Thank you.

1523
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,737
Is that what you're wearing?

1524
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,305
Yeah, why?

1525
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:03,740
No reason.

1526
01:09:05,408 --> 01:09:06,776
-Anything yet from Zoey?
-No.

1527
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,778
Calls are going
straight to voicemail.

1528
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:09,946
Why is...

1529
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,648
...nothing going through?

1530
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,085
Yeah, I think I had
better over here, actually.

1531
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,721
What am I gonna do?
How could this be the one spot

1532
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,557
that there's absolutely
no service?

1533
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,960
Zoey, Zoey, hey, hey.

1534
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,595
I think we can make it,
but we have to go.

1535
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,197
We have to walk now.

1536
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,165
-Okay.
-Come on.

1537
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,738
Yeah, it'll be good.
Here we go.

1538
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:39,843
Have you heard from Chase
this morning?

1539
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,245
Nobody can get
a hold of him.

1540
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,011
No, I haven't.

1541
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,482
Wow, you look so good.

1542
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:47,451
Thanks. So do you.

1543
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:50,019
-Have you heard from Zoey?
-No, I haven't.

1544
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:52,488
Wait. Is this supposed
to be their first look?

1545
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,157
- They're weird like that.
- Wait.

1546
01:09:54,258 --> 01:09:57,126
So the maid of honor and
the best man are both missing?

1547
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:58,595
I can't believe this.

1548
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,767
How much farther?

1549
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:05,969
Oh. Here.

1550
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,238
Okay. Thank you.

1551
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,474
Here, you wear mine.

1552
01:10:11,275 --> 01:10:12,476
Oh, that's so much better.

1553
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:13,710
Yeah, this is...

1554
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,612
-This is not better.
-Okay.

1555
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:17,914
Oh, God.

1556
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:09,032
So normally I could not
afford Montecito,

1557
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:13,169
but I can afford Montecito
if the house has had a murder,

1558
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,705
-which this one has.
-Uh-huh.

1559
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,007
-The whole first floor--
-I think that might be wet.

1560
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:23,513
What is that?

1561
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,282
Uh, it's "White Diamond,"
Mr. Kevyn.

1562
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:28,585
Benjamin Moore?

1563
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:29,686
This is a great shade.

1564
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:30,854
I mean, I love it.

1565
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,489
Will you paint my office
that color?

1566
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:34,424
-Yeah.
-Great. Now?

1567
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:35,759
-Oh. Yeah. Yes, sir.
-Now!

1568
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,927
No, in the future. Now!

1569
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,163
-Greg!
-Hi, hi.

1570
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:41,765
Hey.

1571
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:46,336
Does anyone have eyes
on the car?

1572
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,343
Oh, God.

1573
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:55,412
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

1574
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:56,813
Okay.

1575
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,591
-Hello?
-Oh, my God!

1576
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,559
I thought you were dead!
I hoped you were dead!

1577
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:10,760
I've called you
like a thousand times.

1578
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,229
-Where the hell are you?
-I know, I know.

1579
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,099
So I didn't exactly realize that
the car needed to be charged.

1580
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,934
So it's dead on the side
of the PCH.

1581
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,769
Oh, my God!

1582
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:21,738
But it's okay.

1583
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,673
The car doesn't even
need to be there...

1584
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,777
because Jordan B. is going
to listen to what I say.

1585
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,146
How are you gonna tell him what
to say if you're not here?

1586
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:32,416
Archer, you're gonna
have to trust me on this one.

1587
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:34,384
Well, I actually don't.

1588
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:36,119
Um...

1589
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:37,954
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but it sounds like

1590
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:40,323
you've gotten yourself into
quite a complicated situation.

1591
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:42,125
You have no idea.

1592
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,783
Okay, we have waited
as long as we can, all right?

1593
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,117
These guests are gonna leave

1594
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,986
if we have to listen to Lyric
sing anymore.

1595
01:13:10,554 --> 01:13:11,555
Wait.

1596
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:13,557
We're here.
And we have the rings.

1597
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:15,258
Quinn, I'm so sorry.
I can explain.

1598
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:18,695
No. No explanations, all right?
We are late enough as it is.

1599
01:13:18,795 --> 01:13:21,264
Places. Go. Go.

1600
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,235
Cue Lyric.

1601
01:13:32,308 --> 01:13:33,777
Cue me.

1602
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,128
And cue Michael and Mark.

1603
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,031
* This *

1604
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:58,301
* Is my gift to you *

1605
01:13:58,401 --> 01:13:59,736
* A song *

1606
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:01,571
* For your day brand-new *

1607
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:02,806
Cue Camille and Jared.

1608
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:04,173
* Written *

1609
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:06,275
* By me *

1610
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,612
* For you *

1611
01:14:08,712 --> 01:14:11,014
* You together *

1612
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:16,085
* She's in her wedding dress *

1613
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:20,456
* And he's hoping
she'll say yes... *

1614
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:22,592
I was really worried
about you.

1615
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:23,993
I know. I'm so sorry.

1616
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,829
* I wrote it for the both... *

1617
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:27,597
And Zoey and Chase.

1618
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:29,198
* Ooh *

1619
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:34,437
* I just want you both
to know *

1620
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:36,439
* That I wrote this song *

1621
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,474
* Yeah, I wrote this song *

1622
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:40,109
Thirty seconds to showtime.

1623
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,811
Thirty seconds, everybody.

1624
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:43,947
Hey, what am I supposed to do?

1625
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,582
Are you seriously
asking me that?

1626
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:47,817
-Yes.
-If you pick a Pontiac over me

1627
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:49,118
on live television,

1628
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:51,921
I will make your life
a living hell, hmm?

1629
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,590
Hey, pal.

1630
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,459
Pre-show jitters
are totally normal, okay?

1631
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,864
Here's what I want you to do.
Just relax and listen to Zoey.

1632
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,166
-Can you do that for me?
-I think so.

1633
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,101
You're gonna be great.

1634
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,571
-Oh, who's Zoey?
-She's not here, dude.

1635
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,372
You'll have to manage this
on your own.

1636
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:12,208
-Nice hair, by the way.
-Thanks.

1637
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:15,244
-Fifteen seconds.
-Wow, okay, Joey. Thank you.

1638
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,116
And paging Zoey.

1639
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:23,920
Zoey, do you copy?

1640
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:27,123
Where's the girl?

1641
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,359
I'm here. I'm here, Jordan.

1642
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:32,796
You got this, buddy.
Just take a deep breath for me.

1643
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:36,733
This should be fun.

1644
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,434
Please rise.

1645
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:00,389
Welcome to
the LOVE: Fully Charged

1646
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,726
season six live finale!

1647
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:07,631
I'm your host, Archer March.
Three couples remain.

1648
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:09,198
But only one can win.

1649
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,835
And that couple will soon
be revealed.

1650
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:16,840
First, let's look
at some highlights

1651
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:17,907
from this juicy season.

1652
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,191
Love you.

1653
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:41,631
You may be seated.

1654
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,567
No?

1655
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:47,937
Dearly beloved...

1656
01:16:48,037 --> 01:16:49,773
Are you ready, America?

1657
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,743
I don't know about you,
but my heart is racing.

1658
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,345
Ugh, I'm sorry.
I just hate their faces.

1659
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,480
Is it just me?

1660
01:16:58,114 --> 01:16:59,983
Don't-- I'd like you
not to answer.

1661
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,686
...of two of my very favorite
people in the world.

1662
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:06,756
A genius, whose discoveries
will define a generation,

1663
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:08,591
and my rich friend,
Logan Reese.

1664
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:14,397
the winners of LOVE:
Fully Charged season six are...

1665
01:17:14,898 --> 01:17:15,999
Jordan B. and Jordyn J.!

1666
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,903
Congratulations, you guys.

1667
01:17:20,003 --> 01:17:22,505
Wow. This is so well-deserved.

1668
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:24,307
How are you feeling right now?

1669
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:25,942
Uh...

1670
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:27,110
Say, "It wouldn't
have been possible

1671
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,778
without this beautiful woman."

1672
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:31,748
It wouldn't have been possible
without this beautiful woman.

1673
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:32,882
Aw!

1674
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,885
Oh, um, did the maid of honor

1675
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:37,887
have something
she wanted to say?

1676
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,622
Oh, no! God!

1677
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,391
Oh, no! God!

1678
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,659
Sorry.

1679
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,429
I'm just so overwhelmed
with emotion.

1680
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,532
Uh-huh. Um, as I was saying...

1681
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:52,368
Sorry, I'm just so overwhelmed
with emotion.

1682
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,972
Okay, well, um,
don't get too excited,

1683
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,340
because it's not over yet.

1684
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,142
You still have a very big
decision to make.

1685
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:02,411
Tight on the garage.
Perfect. Very nice.

1686
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,681
Should anyone present
know of any reason

1687
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:09,285
that this couple should not
be joined in holy matrimony,

1688
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:13,122
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1689
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:19,028
Stacey.

1690
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,669
You.

1691
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,704
It's you.

1692
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:31,741
Mark.

1693
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,576
Hugo.

1694
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,611
You were right under my nose.

1695
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,280
How did I not see it sooner?

1696
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,516
First, you came to the welcome
reception in dirty scrubs,

1697
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:44,353
and no self-respecting ER doctor
would ever leave the hospital

1698
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:45,855
in dirty scrubs.

1699
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,724
Two, you said you were
from Burbank,

1700
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50,693
which is not in Australia.

1701
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:52,295
And also...

1702
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,464
you have massive hands.

1703
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:57,033
Hey, look...

1704
01:18:57,133 --> 01:19:01,170
Everyone, this man
is not the charming,

1705
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,439
selfless, hilarious,

1706
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:08,011
extremely jacked Hemsworth
cousin that we all thought.

1707
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:11,915
This man is the Malibu Murderer!

1708
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:14,483
Wait, wait? Murderer?

1709
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,652
No, no, no, no. I...

1710
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:19,688
I'm not a murderer.

1711
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,527
I'm an actor.

1712
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:29,698
Jordan B., what do you love most
about Jordyn J.?

1713
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:32,268
-What's going on?
-Nothing, absolutely nothing.

1714
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,570
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

1715
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,375
Jordan B.,
we're all a little confused.

1716
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:41,845
What is it that you really want?

1717
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:46,149
If it's absolutely nothing,
then why were you late?

1718
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:47,951
It was the car! The car!

1719
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,785
No, Jordan, not you.

1720
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:51,855
The car. Oh, the car!

1721
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,556
No, Jordan, not you.

1722
01:19:56,826 --> 01:19:58,227
Can you explain all of this?

1723
01:19:58,327 --> 01:19:59,795
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

1724
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:01,464
Am I hearing you correctly?

1725
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,566
You're choosing the car?

1726
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:06,335
Yes. Sorry. Of course.

1727
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:09,805
Open the garage, I guess.

1728
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:18,314
Where is the car?

1729
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:21,684
Where is the effing car?

1730
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:22,952
Greg?

1731
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:25,521
Are you watching
LOVE: Fully Charged ?

1732
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:27,123
Oh! Who won?

1733
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,159
What is going on?

1734
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:34,830
I'm working.

1735
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:36,565
I'm working during your wedding.

1736
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:40,269
I got an opportunity,
and I tried to do both.

1737
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,505
If you had to work,
why didn't you just tell me?

1738
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:46,175
Because this is so important,
and you were so excited.

1739
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:49,178
So I lied. To myself, to you.

1740
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:50,746
To everyone.

1741
01:20:52,648 --> 01:20:55,784
What about him?
What is Stacey talking about?

1742
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,386
Hugo is not a murderer.

1743
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:00,856
I'm not sure how she came
to that conclusion.

1744
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:04,193
His name is Todd,

1745
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:07,663
and I hired him to be
my boyfriend for the weekend.

1746
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,633
I knew something
was going on with you.

1747
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:14,237
You've been distant
and distracted,

1748
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:17,740
and you completely abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1749
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:21,110
To do what? Hang out with Chase?

1750
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:23,646
Zoey, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

1751
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:25,381
Logan, don't even start.

1752
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,384
You care more about
making this wedding a spectacle

1753
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:30,353
than about making it meaningful.

1754
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:34,257
You completely ignored me
every step of the way.

1755
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:38,261
None of this is what I wanted.

1756
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:43,832
Our wedding is off.

1757
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:52,175
* If I'm so smart *

1758
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:56,879
* Why do I feel so dumb? *

1759
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,616
* Why did you take *

1760
01:22:00,716 --> 01:22:03,519
* My heart *

1761
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:07,957
* Then just cut and run? *

1762
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:14,063
* And if the pain is real *

1763
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:19,602
* Why do I feel so numb? *

1764
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:25,975
* And if I'm so smart... *

1765
01:22:27,043 --> 01:22:29,512
I don't know what's happening.

1766
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,547
I don't know
what's happening.

1767
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:34,350
I could do
everyone's job in here

1768
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,386
better than everyone who
is not doing their job in here.

1769
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,322
Everyone's fired. Get out.

1770
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:41,890
* ...feel so down *

1771
01:22:43,126 --> 01:22:45,094
* Why do I see *

1772
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:47,096
So I guess this is a wrap
on me then, huh?

1773
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,766
Yeah. Thanks for everything
this weekend.

1774
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,169
I'm so sorry I dragged you
into all this,

1775
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:54,770
and I can't even
get you on the show.

1776
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,572
I'm an actor in L.A.

1777
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:59,608
I kind of expect
to be disappointed.

1778
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:02,345
You got my head shot
and resume?

1779
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:03,912
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1780
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:10,719
* If I'm so high *

1781
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:14,790
* Why do I feel so down? *

1782
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:21,030
* And if I'm so brave *

1783
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:26,001
* Why do I feel so scared? *

1784
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:32,608
* Why did you tell me stay *

1785
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:36,545
* Then just disappear *

1786
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,415
* And if it's true *

1787
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:43,119
* You're going *

1788
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:48,857
* Why do I still
feel you here? *

1789
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:54,029
* So long, farewell *

1790
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,998
* Goodbye *

1791
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:59,802
* So long, farewell *

1792
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:01,537
* Goodbye *

1793
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:05,474
* So long, farewell *

1794
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,910
* Goodbye *

1795
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:10,679
-Hey.
-Hey.

1796
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:15,818
So, did you talk to Danielle?
I mean, I feel awful.

1797
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:20,022
Zoey, I...
I have a confession.

1798
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:23,959
Danielle and I actually broke up
two weeks ago.

1799
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:26,729
She agreed to still
come with me to the wedding

1800
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:28,464
so I didn't have
to show up alone.

1801
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:31,600
Well, at least you didn't
hire an actor.

1802
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,802
Yeah, there's that.

1803
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:40,976
How did I screw this up so bad,

1804
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,745
and when did life get so messy?

1805
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:44,780
I know we thought
high school was hard,

1806
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,217
but I would kill
to go back to PCA.

1807
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:52,155
Yeah, it's too bad Quinn hasn't
invented a time machine yet.

1808
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,390
I'm sure we'd all love
to go back.

1809
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:56,625
Yeah.

1810
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:02,731
Go back.

1811
01:25:03,466 --> 01:25:05,234
That's exactly
what we need to do.

1812
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:06,702
Uh, what?

1813
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,989
This is gonna take a while.

1814
01:25:29,592 --> 01:25:31,394
All right, people,
let's get to work.

1815
01:25:31,494 --> 01:25:32,895
Let's do it.

1816
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,631
Think there's anything left

1817
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,633
in the old
arts and crafts studio?

1818
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:41,404
You know, this is great and all,

1819
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,838
but what if I can't
get her here?

1820
01:25:42,938 --> 01:25:45,541
I've tried flower arrangements,
edible arrangements,

1821
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,210
a sky writer, nothing.

1822
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:49,144
Have you tried talking to her?

1823
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:51,314
-No!
-Maybe try that.

1824
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:53,449
-There's so much to do.
-I know. I know.

1825
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:55,918
Do you mind helping Ms. Reese
with lights over there?

1826
01:25:56,018 --> 01:25:57,052
Thank you.

1827
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,822
I don't know, Mark!
Just be helpful!

1828
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,424
-I'm trying.
-Here, I'll help.

1829
01:26:01,524 --> 01:26:03,025
-Thank you.
-Got it.

1830
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,061
Zoey!

1831
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,596
Look what I found!

1832
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:10,165
No, no, you're under strict
vocal rest until it's time.

1833
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,901
Is this cake?

1834
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:16,004
-Yeah.
-I knew it.

1835
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:17,740
Okay, okay.

1836
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,342
Okay, listen,
I know that we thought

1837
01:26:19,442 --> 01:26:20,776
Sushi Rox closed
when the school did,

1838
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,845
but it turns out Kazu's son
started a food truck,

1839
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:24,547
and they'd be more than happy
to cater.

1840
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,615
Perfect. She loves sushi.

1841
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:28,417
Cool, I think
that covers everything, right?

1842
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,852
Except for music.

1843
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:31,654
I know that Quinn was really
excited about the band,

1844
01:26:31,754 --> 01:26:33,456
but unfortunately
they're unavailable today.

1845
01:26:33,556 --> 01:26:34,890
So who are we gonna get
to play the music?

1846
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,024
Me.

1847
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:37,926
I'm a DJ too.

1848
01:26:39,262 --> 01:26:42,164
* You're welcome *

1849
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,033
Sounds pretty good.
That settles it.

1850
01:26:46,068 --> 01:26:47,470
So, what do we do now?

1851
01:26:48,237 --> 01:26:50,773
Now? We wait.

1852
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,738
I'm so sorry, Quinn!

1853
01:27:24,106 --> 01:27:26,241
Maybe this all happened
for a reason.

1854
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,211
Maybe we just want
different things.

1855
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,281
-And maybe that's okay.
-No!

1856
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,685
I don't want different things.
I only want what you want.

1857
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,456
I was trying so hard
to make this wedding perfect

1858
01:27:40,556 --> 01:27:42,658
for me and for you.

1859
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:45,561
I stopped thinking about us.

1860
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:46,895
I was an idiot.

1861
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,031
I was worse than an idiot.
I was--

1862
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:50,265
A groomzilla?

1863
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:51,767
Yes.

1864
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,736
Is that a thing?

1865
01:27:54,503 --> 01:27:56,972
All I know is I want
to be with you...

1866
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,075
because I love you, Quinn.

1867
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:04,046
I love you too, Logan.

1868
01:28:04,747 --> 01:28:07,182
I love Quinn Pensky!

1869
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,185
And I love Logan Reese!

1870
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,087
Shut up!

1871
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:15,257
Hang on, I'll buzz you up.

1872
01:28:15,358 --> 01:28:16,792
Can you come down?

1873
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,562
I was hoping we could go
for a ride.

1874
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:22,631
Logan, where are we?
What are we doing?

1875
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:57,032
Hi.

1876
01:28:57,466 --> 01:28:58,701
Hi.

1877
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:00,836
What is all this?

1878
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:02,638
Did you do this?

1879
01:29:02,738 --> 01:29:04,306
We all did.

1880
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:08,343
Quinn, I'm so sorry.

1881
01:29:09,445 --> 01:29:11,013
You can't not marry
your best friend

1882
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:13,281
because your other best friend
ruined it.

1883
01:29:15,384 --> 01:29:16,952
But I'm wearing this.

1884
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:18,954
Well, you did always say

1885
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:21,323
that you'd rather get married
in a lab coat.

1886
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:28,196
Here.

1887
01:29:33,135 --> 01:29:35,638
How do you feel?

1888
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,207
Like myself.

1889
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:47,182
Quinn Pensky...

1890
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:50,118
will you marry me still?

1891
01:29:51,554 --> 01:29:53,021
-Yes?
-Yeah.

1892
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,558
Yes! Yes!

1893
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:58,527
She said yes.

1894
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,108
Dearly beloved.

1895
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:16,078
Just kidding!

1896
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:19,715
We're gathered here today

1897
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:21,684
to celebrate this beautiful love

1898
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:24,953
between Quinn Pensky
and Logan Reese.

1899
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:31,126
Seriously, best ceremony
I've ever heard.

1900
01:30:31,226 --> 01:30:33,862
I mean, hilarious,
heartbreaking, personal.

1901
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,163
Did you write that yourself?

1902
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,765
I've been writing that
since high school

1903
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:37,933
when they first fell in love.

1904
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:39,535
You should do our wedding.

1905
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:41,837
Oh, I'm down.
Let's do it. Let's go!

1906
01:30:43,906 --> 01:30:44,840
Oh, excuse me.

1907
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,308
I have to take this.

1908
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,747
Kelley, I know
what you're going to say,

1909
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:53,716
and my stuff will be out
of the office on Monday.

1910
01:30:53,816 --> 01:30:55,417
I'm promoting you.

1911
01:30:55,518 --> 01:30:56,485
You're what?

1912
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:57,586
The numbers are in.

1913
01:30:57,686 --> 01:30:59,855
It was the highest-rated

1914
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,090
Fully Charged
finale ever.

1915
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,928
The network is sharting
their brains with happiness.

1916
01:31:06,028 --> 01:31:09,364
They want a spin-off
with both Jordans.

1917
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,466
I want you on my team.

1918
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:14,402
-I don't know what to say.
-There is so much more to you

1919
01:31:14,503 --> 01:31:15,638
than meets the eye.

1920
01:31:15,738 --> 01:31:16,772
You have so much more
to offer.

1921
01:31:16,872 --> 01:31:19,307
What you did by throwing out

1922
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:21,476
every reality TV trope,

1923
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:24,212
by ignoring me at every turn,

1924
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,014
that took balls.

1925
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,485
I respect balls.

1926
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:33,488
-You're right.
-What?

1927
01:31:33,589 --> 01:31:35,357
I do have a lot to offer.

1928
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:37,626
And I'm tired of wasting it
on people who don't deserve it,

1929
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:38,761
like you.

1930
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:40,529
-I quit.
-I'll double your salary.

1931
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,499
-And give me the corner office?
-Yeah, sure.

1932
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,168
And fire Greg?

1933
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:48,571
-Hey, Greg?
-What?

1934
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:49,905
You're fired.

1935
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:53,375
All right.

1936
01:31:53,876 --> 01:31:56,745
- Yeah, done.
- Oh, there he is! Todd!

1937
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,116
One more thing.

1938
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:05,921
Deal.

1939
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:09,224
Hey, Jordan?

1940
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:12,260
Go home.

1941
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:14,362
I don't know where I live!

1942
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,500
I am sorry that I accused you
of being a murderer,

1943
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:21,069
but you have to understand
it was not my fault.

1944
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:24,006
It was Mark's.
Mark, what did you do?

1945
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:26,141
I followed a bad lead.

1946
01:32:26,241 --> 01:32:29,377
That's right. And what do you
have to say to Quinn?

1947
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:32,648
I am sorry
we ruined your wedding?

1948
01:32:32,748 --> 01:32:33,916
We?

1949
01:32:34,016 --> 01:32:36,184
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.

1950
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:37,185
Better.

1951
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:41,056
Oh, I am also very sorry,
but he does not speak for me.

1952
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:43,091
No, it's a feminism thing.

1953
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:45,127
We do that--
Where are you going?

1954
01:32:45,594 --> 01:32:46,829
Todd, you made it.

1955
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:49,131
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I manny on the weekends.

1956
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,066
Well, you may not
have to anymore,

1957
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,001
because I got you on the show!

1958
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:54,837
-No.
-Yes!

1959
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:58,506
Thank you!

1960
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:00,208
Everybody, get out of the way.

1961
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,811
Quinn and my dumb brother
are gonna do their first dance.

1962
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:08,917
-So...
-Tell me.

1963
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,702
This wedding sucks.
Where are the oyster shuckers?

1964
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,537
All right, I deserved that.

1965
01:33:31,674 --> 01:33:34,409
* I *

1966
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:42,384
* Don't know *

1967
01:33:46,722 --> 01:33:50,092
* Don't care *

1968
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:57,632
-* Won't go *
-Phew.

1969
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:02,705
You want to dance?

1970
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,240
* You say *

1971
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,509
What's next, Chase Matthews?

1972
01:34:07,609 --> 01:34:08,777
Back to Baltimore?

1973
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,146
You know,
it is really cold out there.

1974
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:13,015
Well, I heard,
and don't quote me,

1975
01:34:13,115 --> 01:34:16,685
but I heard there are schools
in California.

1976
01:34:16,785 --> 01:34:18,086
Oh, well...

1977
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,288
Well, maybe I'll look into that.

1978
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,491
But whatever the future holds...

1979
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:25,694
I hope that you're in it.

1980
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:27,462
Because...

1981
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:29,431
I love you, Zoey.

1982
01:34:30,699 --> 01:34:32,100
And I always have.

1983
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,836
I...

1984
01:34:33,936 --> 01:34:35,003
love you too.

1985
01:34:51,954 --> 01:34:53,455
Ugh, I'm bored.

1986
01:34:54,857 --> 01:34:58,693
* Starships were meant to fly *

1987
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:02,397
* Hands up and touch the sky *

1988
01:35:02,497 --> 01:35:06,401
* Can't stop,
'cause we're so high *

1989
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:09,571
* Let's do this one more time *

1990
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,042
* Starships were meant to fly *

1991
01:35:14,142 --> 01:35:17,980
* Hands up and touch the sky *

1992
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,683
* Let's do this one last time *

1993
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:25,120
* Can't stop,
we're higher than a mother... *

1994
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:29,091
Toss it back! Woo!

1995
01:35:30,759 --> 01:35:33,028
* We're higher
than a mother... *

1996
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,702
* We're higher
than a mother... *

1997
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:44,139
* Starships were meant
to fly... *

1998
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,607
I hear you're, like,
a producer.

1999
01:35:45,707 --> 01:35:46,674
Heard of Drippin' ?

2000
01:35:46,775 --> 01:35:48,143
And you're friends with Logan?

2001
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,778
And he didn't
introduce me to you?

2002
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:51,947
Logan, you always do this to me!

2003
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:54,016
You never support me
in any of my endeavors!

2004
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:55,483
I support you. Don't--

2005
01:35:56,218 --> 01:35:59,187
* Starships were meant to fly *

2006
01:35:59,287 --> 01:36:01,456
Good for you for picking up
on the rebound, you know?

2007
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,158
Yeah!

2008
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,360
-Yeah. Yeah!
-Yeah.

2009
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,494
Sloppy seconds.

2010
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:11,466
* Can't stop,
we're higher than a mother... *

2011
01:36:17,139 --> 01:36:19,207
* We're higher
than a mother... *

2012
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:26,514
* We're higher
than a mother... *

2013
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:31,119
I know you're bummed we didn't
catch him this time, Stace,

2014
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:32,587
but we will.

2015
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:33,956
We always do.

2016
01:36:34,056 --> 01:36:36,925
That's why we're the number one
murder podcast in America.

2017
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:38,160
Yeah.

2018
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:39,962
You're probably right.

2019
01:36:40,062 --> 01:36:41,930
So great meeting you, Todd.

2020
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,999
Sorry again
about that little mix-up.

2021
01:36:44,099 --> 01:36:45,800
Oh, don't even worry about it.

2022
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:47,970
You guys get home safe, okay?

2023
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:52,740
Shh.

2024
01:37:00,048 --> 01:37:01,483
I have ideas.

2025
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:03,718
Excuse me, did I wink?

2026
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:07,255
You're loving it, Mr. Perry.

2027
01:37:07,355 --> 01:37:09,624
Oh, I am.

2028
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:12,594
Mr. Perry,
you own a jewelry shop.

2029
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:13,761
I'm loving it too.

2030
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:17,933
Bubbe! What are you doing?

2031
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:20,002
Oh, I thought you were cake.

2032
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:22,971
-No, it's me.
-I almost ate you.

2033
01:37:23,071 --> 01:37:24,306
Here, I got your back.

2034
01:37:24,406 --> 01:37:25,640
Oh, my God!

2035
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,943
-We're in a car!
-It didn't smell bad.

2036
01:37:29,111 --> 01:37:31,313
Somebody help me. My God.

2037
01:37:31,413 --> 01:37:33,481
With a 300-mile driving radius--

2038
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:35,483
Uh-huh, what's the line?

2039
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,986
I'm sorry to this camera
that has to go back and forth.

2040
01:37:38,086 --> 01:37:39,154
Loving you.

2041
01:37:39,254 --> 01:37:42,090
* Yeah, yeah *

2042
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,591
* Tell the DJ... *

2043
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:44,559
And...

2044
01:37:44,659 --> 01:37:46,694
Could you play that back?

2045
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,264
* Yeah *

2046
01:37:50,532 --> 01:37:53,301
Are you guys still filming me?
Can I ask an honest question?

2047
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:55,537
Can you tell that these are
ladies' leggings?

2048
01:37:56,604 --> 01:37:58,873
I don't think you can tell.
Right?

2049
01:38:01,143 --> 01:38:03,045
* Yeah, yeah *

2050
01:38:03,145 --> 01:38:04,279
I'm good.

2051
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:06,081
Cut.

2052
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:07,749
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

2053
01:38:09,051 --> 01:38:10,252
And that's that.

2054
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:11,886
* Inside your head *

2055
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:15,623
* Just get out
with me instead *

2056
01:38:16,258 --> 01:38:18,927
* Let's melt the stress away *

2057
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,229
* Yeah, yeah *

2058
01:38:21,329 --> 01:38:22,897
* Yeah, yeah, you *

2059
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,003
* Do what you want to do *

2060
01:38:28,703 --> 01:38:31,439
* Be your own kind of muse *

2061
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:34,776
* It's your role to play *

2062
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:37,045
* Yeah, yeah *

2063
01:38:37,145 --> 01:38:39,014
* Tell the DJ play *

2064
01:38:39,114 --> 01:38:40,915
* We can dance all day *

2065
01:38:41,016 --> 01:38:44,552
* Let's just get away, yeah *

2066
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:47,222
* We can make them see *

2067
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:51,093
* All of the things
that we can be *

2068
01:38:51,193 --> 01:38:55,397
* Forget all your fears
and follow me *

2069
01:38:56,298 --> 01:38:59,401
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

2070
01:39:02,037 --> 01:39:05,140
* The stars are shining now *

2071
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,309
* They're shining for you *

2072
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,511
* Shining for you *

2073
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:13,048
* But you don't need
shooting stars *

2074
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:16,384
* The magic's all in you *

2075
01:39:16,484 --> 01:39:18,753
* We can make them see *

2076
01:39:18,853 --> 01:39:22,557
* All of the things
that we can be *

2077
01:39:22,657 --> 01:39:26,628
* Forget all your fears
and follow me *

2078
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:30,865
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

2079
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,102
* Tell the DJ play *

2080
01:39:34,202 --> 01:39:36,004
* We can dance all day *

2081
01:39:36,104 --> 01:39:38,573
* Let's just get away *

2082
01:39:38,673 --> 01:39:40,008
* Yeah *

2083
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:42,344
* We can make them see *

2084
01:39:42,444 --> 01:39:46,181
* All of the things
that we can be *

2085
01:39:46,281 --> 01:39:50,452
* Forget all your fears
and follow me *
