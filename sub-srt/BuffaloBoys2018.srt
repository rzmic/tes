00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:52,544
For centuries, the
ancient lands of Indonesia

7
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:56,568
were colonized by
the Dutch Empire.

8
00:00:56,592 --> 00:01:01,592
Accounts of suppression,
brutality and tragedy

9
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:05,516
are often lost in
taes of folkore.

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,540
This is one story where the
worlds of fact and fiction collide...

11
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,544
CALIFORNIA, TAHUN 1860

12
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:03,568
Ayo, ya pasang
semuanya! Ya begitu!

13
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,592
3 banding 1
untuk pria kecil ini.

14
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,516
3 banding 1
untuk pria kecil ini.

15
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,540
Percayalah, yang bisa
melipat-tigakan uangmu, mau?

16
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,564
Melipat-tigakan
uangmu, cukup gila 'kan.

17
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,588
Ini pertarungan tingkat
banding yang ekstrim.

18
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,612
Kalian siap untuk
pertarungan ini?

19
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:28,536
Ada lagi? / Dia akan
pertaruhkan semua uangnya.

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Ayo.

21
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,584
Coba tendang
lebih keras lagi, kak.

22
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,508
Ya begitu.

23
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:02,532
Ooh!

24
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,556
Sebaiknya menyerah sekarang
selagi gigimu masih utuh, kak.

25
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Terus saja kumpulkan
taruhannya, aku belum selesai.

26
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,604
Kau yakin? / Oh!

27
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,528
Taruhan diganti, 7 banding 1.

28
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:04,552
Terasa baikan?

29
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:12,576
Ya begitu!

30
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Sekarang aku baru
selesai. / Pertarungan bagus.

31
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,524
Baiklah.

32
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:52,548
Jangan lupa bagianku.
/ Kita sudah bunuh satu.

33
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,572
Sialan, kau curang.
Pertarungan dicurangi.

34
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,596
Kau sama tahunya dengan aku kalau
pertarungan kami menangkan dengan adil.

35
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,520
Omong kosong.
Kembalikan uang kami.

36
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,544
Santai, ini cuma permainan, nak.

37
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,568
Kami kembalikan uangmu.

38
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:15,592
Tapi biarkan kami melanjutkan
perjalanan kami dengan damai.

39
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,516
Oh tidak, bos. Ini
keretaku. / Keretamu?

40
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Aku yang kerjakan jalur
kereta ini bersama anak-anakku

41
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,564
sejak kau masih menetek ibumu.

42
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:26,588
Brengsek kau...

43
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:30,512
Paman!

44
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,536
Paman! Sial, Suwo!

45
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Biar kulihat, biar kulihat!

46
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,584
Maaf.

47
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:41,508
Cuma tergores, kau tak apa-apa.

48
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:42,532
Ya. / Tak apa.

49
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,556
Maafkan aku.

50
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
Sekarang saatnya kita pulang.

51
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,504
Aku tak mau mati... sebelum
kita selesaikan masalah ini.

52

BUFFALO BOYS

53
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:24,552
JAVA, 6 MONTHS LATER

54
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,576
Hey, Suwo.

55
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I though I'd never return to
kiss the earth of my homeland

56
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:44,524
that I had left behind.

57
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:55,548
Anak-anak, ingatlah
tujuan kita disini.

58
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,572
Tak ada yang kenal siapa
kita, dan dari mana kita berasal.

59
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,596
Jangan percaya
siapapun, membaurlah.

60
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Dan ingat, gunakan bahasa
ibumu seperti yang kuajarkan.

61
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,544
Come, let's go.

62
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,568
Hurry!

63
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,592
Kapal tak bisa
menunggu seharian.

64
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,516
Ayo.

65
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
Ayo, kalian.

66
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:58,564
First, we must pay our
respect to your faher

67
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:04,588
at the final resting place of
all Sultans and their families.

68
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:51,512
This is your father's grave

69
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:54,536
and this... your mother's.

70
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
God bless her soul.

71
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,584
Seruni.

72
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,508
Forgive me.

73
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:23,532
I should have never left you.

74
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,556
A long time ago,

75
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,580
ancient kings ruled this land.

76
00:10:41,504 --> 00:10:46,504
Civilization here flourished
a thousand years before us.

77
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:51,528
We come from a land
deep with heritage.

78
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,552
And part of it runs
through your blood.

79
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,576
Both of you are born
of noble heritage.

80
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Raised in foreign lands,

81
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,524
united by extreme circumtances.

82
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:15,548
That day, your father
and I managed to escape.

83
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:27,572
We were lucky,

84
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,596
so you survived.

85
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I thought if we could
negotiate with them

86
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:41,944
they would leave us in peace.

87
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,545
How naive.

88
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,569
They need to pay.

89
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:46,593
No.

90
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,617
We've already lost
many of our people today.

91
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,541
Let's not lose our future too.

92
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,565
They're here.

93
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,589
Just get in! Get in!

94
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:55,513
Get in, Hamza.

95
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:56,537
Go now.

96
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,561
I'll delay them.

97
00:13:58,585 --> 00:13:59,785
No, Hamza, we move together.

98
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,586
Arana.

99
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,510
Get as far away as you can.

100
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,534
Bring my boys up as your own.

101
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,558
Save them, Arana.

102
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,582
They are our only hope.

103
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:49,506
Kulihat kau
bertahan dari belatiku,

104
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,530
Sultan Hamza.

105
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:01,554
My death shall only
strengthen the will of my people.

106
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,578
Van Trach.

107
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:19,502
Jamar.

108
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:24,526
As the eldest son, you have
to shoulder the responsibility.

109
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,550
Suwo.

110
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,574
As the youngest

111
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,598
it is your brotherhood bon

112
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:37,522
that will strengthen
the both of you.

113
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:40,546
Don't ever forget that.

114
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,570
Apa yang kau lakukan?
/ Huh? Oh, aku...

115
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,594
Jangan main-main.
/ Bukan, tadi aku...

116
00:15:58,618 --> 00:15:59,618
Jangan bikin jengkel.

117
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,542
Anak-anak... sudahlah.

118
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,566
Kau masih terobsesi
dengan peta itu?

119
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,590
Bagaimana kalau
dia tak ada di sana.

120
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,514
Kita akan cari dia...

121
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,538
dimanapun dia berada.

122
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,562
Dan kali ini, kita pasti siap.

123
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:33,586
Shh.

124
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,510
What do you want?

125
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,534
Do you guys need...

126
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,558
You came from over there.

127
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:52,582
Heading towards there.

128
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:54,606
So why are you stopping here?

129
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,630
Everything OK? /
What are you looking at?

130
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:58,654
Everything is fine.

131
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,678
That's my wife. She's in labor.

132
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,702
She's in labor? / Ya.

133
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:03,726
I can help. / How?

134
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,550
What's that? / I have medicine.

135
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:07,574
What medicine?

136
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:10,598
This is for the pain. / My wife
is not in pain, shes just in labor.

137
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:12,622
But... / Move along!

138
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:14,646
Sorry, sir.

139
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,670
We'll move along.

140
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:19,594
Help!

141
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:37,518
Don't move!

142
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,542
Or Fakar will kill her! /
Calm down. Calm down.

143
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,566
You want to die?

144
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,590
Get back!

145
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:46,514
You think Fakar's
messing around?

146
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:47,538
Think again.

147
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,562
Get back!

148
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,586
Come here.

149
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,510
Sri!

150
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:11,534
It hurts! / Next time,
mind your own business.

151
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:19,558
Wait, wait.

152
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:21,582
Where are you heading?

153
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:24,506
Please come to our village.

154
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,530
There, you can
bathe, eat, and rest.

155
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:32,554
That would be my honor.

156
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,578
Please, come.

157
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:39,502
Hiya!

158
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,550
Ho!

159
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,574
What's happening there?

160
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:23,598
Anak-anak...

161
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:33,522
That man knows how to ride.

162
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,546
I've never seen a man
ride buffalo like that.

163
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,570
And shoot like an
Apache warrior! / Yeah.

164
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,594
Woo!

165
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,518
Hiya!

166
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:21,542
Earlier, I noticed crops being.

167
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,566
Why?

168
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,590
To grow opium.

169
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:31,514
It's more profitable for them.

170
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:35,538
If we don't burn the rice

171
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,562
the Dutch will burn us.

172
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,586
Whoa.

173
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,510
There are the farmers
who chose to plant crop

174
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,534
because they though

175
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,558
feeding their families
was more important.

176
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:00,582
But they had to pay the price.

177
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,506
What's that smell?

178
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,530
This is the stenc...

179
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:22,554
of hatred.

180
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,578
Hey!

181
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,502
Hey!

182
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,526
Hiya!

183
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,550
Oh!

184
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:16,574
Come here, sweetheart.

185
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,598
Grandpa.

186
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,522
What happened to your head?

187
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:24,546
I had a fall. It's
just a scratch.

188
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,570
Gentlemen,

189
00:22:27,594 --> 00:22:29,594
my grand daughter, Kiona.

190
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:31,618
You are an excellent rider.

191
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,642
For a...

192
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,666
girl.

193
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,590
Bawakan topiku.

194
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:40,614
Your riding was spectacular.

195
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,638
I'm Suwo.

196
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:48,562
Suwo, the hand that you kisses

197
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,586
is the hand that
wipes her... / Ass.

198
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:59,510
Your beauty made them
forget their manners.

199
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:02,534
I am Arana.

200
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,558
How's my riding, Grandpa?

201
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:13,582
Kiona.

202
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:15,606
You stole my buffalo again?

203
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,630
I only borrowed him, Father.

204
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:21,554
Your father is the head of the village
while you ride buffaloes as if you're a boy.

205
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:23,578
You embarrass me.

206
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,602
Excuse me.

207
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,626
You should be proud of her.

208
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,650
Who are you people? / Kiona.

209
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:34,574
Sri.

210
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,598
Father, don't... / Silence!

211
00:23:37,622 --> 00:23:39,622
What do you want here? / Sakar.

212
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:42,546
These men are our
friends, not our enemies.

213
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,570
They are... / They
are strangers.

214
00:23:44,594 --> 00:23:46,594
And all strangers are enemies.

215
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,518
If the Dutch finds out we'll
be the ones who pay the price.

216
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,542
Have you no shame.

217
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:54,566
These men saved me
and your daughter Sri.

218
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,590
That's two lives you owe them.

219
00:23:57,514 --> 00:23:59,514
It's true, Father.

220
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,538
If not for them, both
of us would be dead.

221
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:05,562
Forgive me.

222
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,586
I misjudged you.

223
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,510
Come join us for dinner tonight.

224
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:15,534
Would you like to freshen up?

225
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,558
Ah.

226
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,582
Boys, stop showing off.

227
00:24:57,606 --> 00:24:59,606
The ladies are
getting over-excited.

228
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,530
Handsome.

229
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:06,554
We've met before.

230
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:08,578
Where? / In my dreams.

231
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:12,502
I wouldn't forget a
dashing man like that.

232
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:15,526
Maybe you'll remember
once he takes off his sarong.

233
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,550
Boys...

234
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:17,574
Let me help you, handsome.

235
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:19,598
It won't take long. / Boys.

236
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:32,522
These men saved my family.

237
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:37,546
Henceforth, we will
treat them as our family.

238
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,570
Yes.

239
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:41,594
Sir, with all due respect,

240
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:46,518
your father and daughter
should not be travelling alone.

241
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:49,542
I would have sent men
to accompany them,

242
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:53,566
but all our men are
assisting to re-plant the crops.

243
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,590
What?

244
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:57,614
Assisting?

245
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,538
It's forced labor.

246
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:03,562
Forced labor? / You've seen what
happens if we dare to oppose them.

247
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:07,586
Why doesn't the
Sultan do something?

248
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,610
We haven't had a
Sultan for a while.

249
00:26:10,534 --> 00:26:12,534
It suits the Dutch just fine.

250
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:14,558
The Dutch control
everything now.

251
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:16,582
Father, Kiona!

252
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,606
You say too much!

253
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,530
Don't you dare
silence me, Sakar.

254
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:24,554
Our villagers will starve
if we don't have rice.

255
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:27,578
This is hell on earth.

256
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:29,602
Ever since Van Trach returned.

257
00:26:32,526 --> 00:26:35,526
Van Trach? / He
and his men kill, rap

258
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,550
and pillage, without
fear of punishment.

259
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:39,574
Kiona!

260
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,598
And nore of us
dare to fight them.

261
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:43,622
Kiona!

262
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:45,646
Don't pay attention to
my daughter's words.

263
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,570
There's a lot she still
doesn't understand.

264
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:51,594
As long as we
live by their rules

265
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:54,518
we'll live in peace and
they'll leave us alone.

266
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:59,542
"As long as we
live by their rules"

267
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,566
"we'll live in peace".

268
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,590
I believed that once.

269
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,614
But the consequence was...

270
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:14,538
a life was lost.

271
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:34,562
Damn it!

272
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:42,586
I don't need help.

273
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,610
I can manage.

274
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,534
What are you doing here?

275
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,558
Shouldn't you be
inside with the other men

276
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,582
making important decisions.

277
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,606
I don't usually
get to participate

278
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,630
in making important decisions.

279
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,554
Oh, yeah.

280
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:03,578
It's tough, not being
taken seriously.

281
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:08,502
What would you know about
that? / I mean, I know how you feel.

282
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:11,526
I can relate.

283
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,550
Can you really? / As the youngest,
I am also at a disadvantage.

284
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:19,574
No, you have one huge advantage.

285
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,598
You're a man.

286
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,622
You can do whatever you want

287
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,646
whenever you want,
however you want

288
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,670
and with whomever you want.

289
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:29,694
You're not seen as
an embarrassment

290
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:31,718
nor evaluated, and not judge.

291
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,542
And all that is because...

292
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:36,566
you're a man.

293
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,590
You don't think there's
pressure being a man?

294
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,614
I was born with a set of rules.

295
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:46,538
Don't show your feeling.
Be braver, be stronger.

296
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:49,562
Fight, be a hero, win.

297
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:56,586
As if those are the only
virtues that make you a man.

298
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,510
The key is timing.

299
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,534
You're rushin

300
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,558
and therefore, your aim is off.

301
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,582
Are you saying you
have better aim?

302
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,506
Of course.

303
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,530
I'm a man. / Arrogant!

304
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:22,554
Like this.

305
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,578
I only want to help.

306
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:44,502
I'm so happy to see you.

307
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,526
You've been gone for so long.

308
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,550
Distance has forced
me to grow up.

309
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:51,574
Father, Kiona.

310
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,598
I'm tired of hiding.

311
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,522
Moving from village to
village is really tough.

312
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,546
I only want to come home.

313
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,570
We just don't want
you to experience

314
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,594
what we had gone through here.

315
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,518
Though I'm glad you are here.

316
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,542
I also fear for your safety.

317
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,566
They are coming!
They are coming!

318
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,590
They are coming!
They are coming!

319
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:26,514
Ayo pergi.

320
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:27,538
You must leave now.

321
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:29,562
Kiona!

322
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:31,586
Kiona!

323
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,610
Quick! Guide them to the forest.

324
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:34,634
There's no time. /
I'm going with Sri.

325
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,658
It's worse if they
find her with them.

326
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:37,682
But... / Go.

327
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:38,706
Go!

328
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,730
Suwo! / Ready.

329
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,754
Go!

330
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:08,578
That's enough.

331
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,602
Cover it with leaves.

332
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:12,626
Yes, Uncle.

333
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,550
Hurry up!

334
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:29,574
Sir

335
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,598
these are the people,
along with three others

336
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:34,622
who attacked Fakar.

337
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,646
Sir, this is not true.

338
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,670
Not true? / He attacked us.

339
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:40,694
Silence!

340
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:44,518
Where are the others? /
Sir, he tried to rape me.

341
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,542
Who will you believe, sir?

342
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:48,566
Fakar, your loyal servant

343
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,590
who lost an eye for the company.

344
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:54,514
Or...

345
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,538
this cursed whore.

346
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:57,562
Let go!

347
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:59,586
Don't! Don't!

348
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,610
Sri.

349
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,534
She's not even registered.

350
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,558
No stamp.

351
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,582
It's true, sir.

352
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:16,606
There were three other people
here but they've gone now.

353
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,630
Fakar was right!

354
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,654
Fakar was right!

355
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,578
Please, sir

356
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:29,602
don't harm her.

357
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:31,626
She has nothing to do with this.

358
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,650
What are you waiting for?

359
00:32:33,674 --> 00:32:35,674
Register her. / Help, sir!

360
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:37,698
Don't, sir!

361
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:38,722
Step aside!

362
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,546
What's happening?

363
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,570
Registration.

364
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:46,594
For what?

365
00:32:49,518 --> 00:32:51,518
Their stamp on us.

366
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,542
We didn't register Sri.

367
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:56,566
She was too young.

368
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,590
Come!

369
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:15,514
Sri!

370
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:24,538
Hurry up!

371
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:26,562
Where's the little boy, come?

372
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:35,586
Who's that man?

373
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,610
His name is Drost.

374
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,634
Van Trach's right-hand man.

375
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:42,558
Don't run!

376
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:21,582
Take the old man and the girl.

377
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:38,506
Kiona...

378
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,530
Just leave me.

379
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,554
Come.

380
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:48,578
Leave her be.

381
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:50,602
Take the bags.

382
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,526
Forgive me, Sri.

383
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,550
Tomorrow we'll explore the town.

384
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,574
I am sure, Uncle.

385
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:23,598
Van Trach will be there. / Hmm.

386
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,622
The time for reckoning is here.

387
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:47,145

388
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:56,546
This is it, boys.

389
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,570
That's all the rice you
get for that little opium.

390
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,594
Go get some supplies.

391
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:21,618
I will scout around.

392
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,542
Kalian dari mana? Mari masuk.

393
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:26,566
Banyak barang bagus di dalam.

394
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,590
Mari.

395
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,614
Masuklah.

396
00:37:31,538 --> 00:37:33,538
Welcome, gentlemen.

397
00:37:39,562 --> 00:37:41,562
Sir.

398
00:37:41,586 --> 00:37:43,586
I have something
very special for you.

399
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,610
You are sure to like this.

400
00:37:52,534 --> 00:37:55,534
Try this, Scorpion arak.

401
00:37:55,558 --> 00:37:58,558
Makes you strong.

402
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,582
Makes the ladies feel good.

403
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:03,506
If there's one
thing I don't like,

404
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,530
it's that.

405
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:06,554
Scorpions.

406
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,578
Relax, sir. Relax.

407
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:14,502
Sir.

408
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,526
This just came in.

409
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,550
It is a bit pricey.

410
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:20,574
But...

411
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,598
You can use this
over and over again.

412
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:26,522
You pay more

413
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:29,546
but you can last longer.

414
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,570
Count this.

415
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:53,594
Sir, come buy some chickens.

416
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:58,518
How much?

417
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,542
This flower only bloom at night.

418
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:08,566
Kiona?

419
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,590
What are you doing here?

420
00:39:11,614 --> 00:39:13,614
Besides breeding bulls,
Father also grows flowers.

421
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:18,538
Any news about your
grandfather and sister?

422
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:22,562
No news yet

423
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:25,586
just that all the headmen
have been summoned to town.

424
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,510
Will Van Trach be there?

425
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:32,534
He should be.

426
00:39:32,558 --> 00:39:35,558
He summoned my
father specifically.

427
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,582
Come with me.

428
00:39:38,606 --> 00:39:40,606
I was about to go
to the town square.

429
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,530
What's going on?

430
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:22,554
Grandpa.

431
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:24,578
Sri.

432
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:14,502
Van Trach.

433
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,526
Tuan-tuan...

434
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,550
kita semua sepakat untuk
mengurusi masyarakat

435
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:43,574
berdasar keadilan dan
kesejahteraan bersama.

436
00:41:43,598 --> 00:41:47,598
Namun salah satu kalian telah
membiarkan desanya mengecewakan.

437
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:51,522
Salah satu kalian tak setia.

438
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:56,546
Sakar... majulah.

439
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,570
Putrimu menghindari registrasi.

440
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:12,594
Dia dan ayahmu bersekongkol
dengan penjahat asing

441
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:16,518
dan merampok salah satu
anak buahku disaat patroli rutin.

442
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:20,542
Penjahat, yang
singgah di desamu.

443
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,566
Warga sekalian...

444
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,590
aku tak bekerja keras
bertahun-tahun ini

445
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,514
untuk melihat kalian semua
terjerumus kembali dalam anarki

446
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:34,538
di tempat aku
menyelamatkan kalian.

447
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:36,562
Hukum tetaplah hukum.

448
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:39,586
Dan harus ditegakkan.

449
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,510
Aku menemukan
pelaku yang bersalah.

450
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:47,534
Dan hukumannya sudah jelas...

451
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:50,558
hukuman mati.

452
00:42:50,582 --> 00:42:52,582
No!

453
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:00,506
Sekarang seperti
kalian semua tahu

454
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,530
aku ini pengampun.

455
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:07,554
Sebagai Penduduk,
aku bisa mengampuni.

456
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:09,578
Sayangnya...

457
00:43:09,602 --> 00:43:12,502
aku hanya bisa ampuni
salah satu dari mereka.

458
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:37,526
Katakan, kawanku...

459
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,550
...siapa yang harus kuampuni.

460
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:42,574
Sir.

461
00:43:42,598 --> 00:43:44,598
I have serve you well.

462
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,622
Katakan, Sakar.

463
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:48,546
Jika kau memang setia,
kau tak akan ragu berkata.

464
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,570
Please, Sir.

465
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,594
I did everything you asked.

466
00:43:51,618 --> 00:43:54,518
I cannot make this
impossible choice.

467
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,542
They are my family, sir.

468
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,566
They have done nothing wrong.

469
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,590
Quiet, Sakar!

470
00:43:59,614 --> 00:44:02,514
Why are you
bargaining with the devil?

471
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:08,538
I am ready to die, Sakar.

472
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:12,562
But why you have
to beg to this dog!

473
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,586
Why?

474
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,510
Hey, devil invader.

475
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,534
Just kill me!

476
00:44:24,558 --> 00:44:25,558
No, grandpa.

477
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,582
You will rot in
hell soon enough.

478
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:36,506
Don't.

479
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,530
Apa beban pemimpin
terlalu berat bagimu?

480
00:46:03,554 --> 00:46:06,554
Apa kami harus membebaskanmu
dari tugas untuk sementara?

481
00:46:06,578 --> 00:46:08,578
Yes.

482
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:16,502
Sakar, kau pasti kenal
baik aku sekarang.

483
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:20,526
Kau jauh lebih lama mengabdi padaku
dibanding bertindak ini terhadapmu.

484
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,550
Father!

485
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,574
Not here! Too many people.

486
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:29,598
Father!

487
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,622
Father!

488
00:46:34,546 --> 00:46:35,546
Cowards!

489
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:37,570
All of you are cowards!

490
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,594
Kiona, di mata hukum

491
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:48,518
tindakan ayahmu dianggap
pengkhianatan serius.

492
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:51,542
aku tak punya pilihan lain
selain menghukum mati dia.

493
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:56,566
Sebenarnya kuingin
melihat rasa terima kasih

494
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,590
karena mengampuni
nyawa adikmu tercinta.

495
00:46:59,514 --> 00:47:01,514
Apa kau tak mau berterima kasih

496
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:05,538
Kiona?

497
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:07,562
Jangan paksa aku
mencabut pengampunanku.

498
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,586
I am thankful.

499
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,610
Aku tak dengar.

500
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:27,534
I am thankful, sir.

501
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:44,558
Bawa masuk gadis
baru ini ke dalam rumah.

502
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,582
We have to follow him.

503
00:48:31,506 --> 00:48:33,506
Latih gadis baru itu.

504
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,554
Hai.

505
00:49:05,578 --> 00:49:07,578
It's risky, hiding out here.

506
00:49:07,602 --> 00:49:10,502
It's still the closest
we can get to him.

507
00:49:12,526 --> 00:49:14,526
Have you found us a way out?

508
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,550
Don't worry. The cute
girls downstairs told me this.

509
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,574
There is an exit, at the back.

510
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:24,598
Mm.

511
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:26,622
Now we wait.

512
00:49:38,546 --> 00:49:40,546
Sit down, Suwo.

513
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,570
I want to speak
to the two of you.

514
00:49:49,594 --> 00:49:51,594
I have waited for this day.

515
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:55,518
This dagger belonged
to your father.

516
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:02,542
This dagger has been
handed down for generations

517
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,566
to each successive Sultan.

518
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,590
And now, you are
its rightful owner.

519
00:50:10,514 --> 00:50:13,514
The Javanese carry
them for protection.

520
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:17,538
Bring it with you
everywhere you go.

521
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,562
Always keep it with you.

522
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:25,586
Suwo.

523
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,510
All these years,
I've kept this knife.

524
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:32,534
It serves as a reminder to me

525
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:36,558
of the sacrifice and
the pain I've endured.

526
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:40,582
This is now yours.

527
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,506
We all have the same purpose.

528
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,530
We must work together

529
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:49,554
to reach our goal.

530
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:51,578
Remember that well.

531
00:51:09,502 --> 00:51:11,502
I have him.

532
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,526
Relax.

533
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,550
Inhale.

534
00:51:24,574 --> 00:51:26,574
Slow.

535
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:28,598
Then be sure.

536
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:37,522
Ready.

537
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:40,546
Be sure.

538
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,570
There's... There's
a servant in the way.

539
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:46,594
I can't get a clear shot, Uncle.

540
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:48,618
I'll do it.

541
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,542
Die, you son of a bitch!

542
00:52:18,566 --> 00:52:20,566
Uncle?

543
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,590
Uncle?

544
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,514
Uncle?

545
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,538
Uncle?

546
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:43,562
Don't!

547
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:44,586
Uncle!

548
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,610
Paman! / Paman, hey.

549
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:48,634
What's wrong?

550
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:50,658
Suwo, go to the Chinese
store. Get medicine.

551
00:52:50,682 --> 00:52:51,682
Uncle.

552
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:54,506
OK. OK. / I'll look
for another way.

553
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:05,130

aplikasi android bit.ly/togelandroid

554
00:53:21,554 --> 00:53:23,554
I'm so sorry.

555
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:26,578
Your father and
grandfather were brave men.

556
00:53:31,502 --> 00:53:33,502
You see that old
lady over there?

557
00:53:34,526 --> 00:53:36,526
Van Trach's gang killed her son.

558
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,550
Or rather, hunted
him down for pleasure.

559
00:53:41,574 --> 00:53:43,574
They returned his
bullet-ridden bod

560
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,598
but without his head.

561
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:49,522
The bar owner likes
keeping it as a trophy.

562
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,546
She can't rest until
her son is whole again.

563
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,570
But no one can help her.

564
00:53:57,594 --> 00:54:01,594
This is our life living
under Van Trach's rule.

565
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:06,518
You're the pretty girl
Fakar talked about?

566
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,542
I want to introduce you...

567
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:13,566
to some of our hungry boys.

568
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,590
Come.

569
00:54:20,614 --> 00:54:22,614
Hey...

570
00:55:06,538 --> 00:55:08,538
Itu pacarmu?

571
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:10,562
You!

572
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:14,586
Long time to see.

573
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,510
Duduk.

574
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:24,534
Diam.

575
00:55:31,558 --> 00:55:33,558
Cyclops. What are you doing?

576
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:35,582
Looking for lice. Why?

577
00:55:35,606 --> 00:55:38,506
If you plan on blowing his
brains out all over my bar

578
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,530
you better think twice.

579
00:55:43,554 --> 00:55:45,554
Fine.

580
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,578
Fakar is watching you.

581
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:07,502
I've been watching you.

582
00:56:07,526 --> 00:56:09,526
What do you want here?

583
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,550
Suwo, watch out!

584
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:22,574
Lihat, kau lihat?

585
00:56:22,598 --> 00:56:25,598
You have balls of steel.

586
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,622
Coming into my bar like that.

587
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:29,646
Fine.

588
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,670
I'll leave.

589
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,594
But first...

590
00:56:36,618 --> 00:56:40,518
How about that trophy...

591
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,542
and the girl over there...

592
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:50,566
In exchange for your lives.

593
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,590
You're funny.

594
00:57:02,514 --> 00:57:04,514
But it seems, the
collection on my wall

595
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:06,538
will be much better...

596
00:57:08,562 --> 00:57:10,562
with another skull.

597
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,586
Suwo.

598
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,510
What's happening here?

599
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:01,534
You must be ready. He
might come to you tonight.

600
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:06,558
Why are you still here?

601
01:00:07,582 --> 01:00:09,582
We can find a way to escape.

602
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,506
Many have tried.

603
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,530
They are always captured

604
01:00:16,554 --> 01:00:19,554
and hung on the
Banyan tree outside.

605
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:24,578
How can you stand this?

606
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,502
My husband

607
01:00:28,526 --> 01:00:30,526
and my entire
family have vanished.

608
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:38,550
I have no one else but myself.

609
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:43,574
No one else.

610
01:00:57,598 --> 01:01:01,598
Kau tahu, aku selalu
bersikap lembut padamu.

611
01:01:02,522 --> 01:01:05,522
Kau satu-satunya orang
yang tak berusaha lari.

612
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:09,546
Mungkin itu sifat cerdas
yang bisa kukagumi.

613
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,570
Indah bukan?

614
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:46,594
Kuambil kalung ini

615
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:50,518
karena ini hadiah ibuku dari
seorang pengagum rahasianya.

616
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:54,542
Dia tak pernah memakainya
karena takut pada ayahku.

617
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:56,566
Tapi dia menyimpannya,

618
01:01:56,590 --> 01:02:02,590
karena ini yang paling dekat
dan membuat dia bahagia.

619
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,514
Dan oleh karena itu...

620
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:10,538
kuingin kau memakainya.

621
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:16,562
I'm not your mother.

622
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:19,586
I do not want to be
linked to your past.

623
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,610
Dasar sundal!

624
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:41,534
Where are you going?

625
01:03:42,558 --> 01:03:43,558
To clear my head

626
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:45,582
get some air.

627
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:47,606
Wait, Uncle. Look.

628
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,530
Kami menangkap orang asing itu.

629
01:03:56,554 --> 01:03:58,554
Go find Suwo.

630
01:04:01,578 --> 01:04:03,578
Aren't you coming, Uncle?

631
01:04:03,602 --> 01:04:05,602
No.

632
01:04:05,626 --> 01:04:07,626
Meet me at the village later.

633
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:09,650
Van Trach?

634
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:11,674
Find your brother first. Go.

635
01:04:20,598 --> 01:04:23,598
Kalian, ikut aku.

636
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,522
Ah.

637
01:06:11,546 --> 01:06:14,546
Katakan yang kau ketahui
tentang pria-pria itu?

638
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,570
Siapa mereka?

639
01:06:18,594 --> 01:06:20,594
You won't get
anything out of me.

640
01:06:20,618 --> 01:06:23,518
Kurasa registrasi
stempelnya perlu diperbarui.

641
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:25,542
Fakar will get the brand ready.

642
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:26,566
Don't!

643
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,590
Use the knife.

644
01:06:35,514 --> 01:06:36,514
Oh.

645
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:38,538
Tunggu! Dari mana
kau mendapatkan itu?

646
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,562
It's not Fakar's.

647
01:06:40,586 --> 01:06:42,586
It was on the table.

648
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,610
It belongs to him.

649
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:48,534
Dari mana kau menemukan ini?

650
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:50,558
Answer!

651
01:06:50,582 --> 01:06:52,582
Think hard.

652
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:55,583
Where did you last leave it.

653
01:06:57,507 --> 01:06:59,507
Sultan Hamza.

654
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,531
Siapa dirimu, bocah?

655
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:06,555
I am his son.

656
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,579
Anaknya?

657
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:13,503
Aku sangat ingat hari itu.

658
01:07:14,527 --> 01:07:16,527
Sir...

659
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,551
there's an intruder
in your house.

660
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:23,575
Arana?

661
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,499
Urus dia, habisi dia.

662
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Thank you, sir.

663
01:07:28,524 --> 01:07:30,524
Kau tetap disini.

664
01:07:41,548 --> 01:07:44,548
You're not in hurry, are you?

665
01:07:45,572 --> 01:07:47,572
Leave him! He's had enough.

666
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,596
Stop torturing him. / I
see, you want one too?

667
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,520
Where do you want
Fakar to put yours?

668
01:07:57,544 --> 01:08:01,544
How about here?

669
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:06,568
Or should Fakar go
for your forehead?

670
01:08:06,592 --> 01:08:08,592
Yes.

671
01:08:09,516 --> 01:08:11,516
The forehead will do.

672
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,540
Are you all right?

673
01:08:24,564 --> 01:08:26,564
Thank you.

674
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:33,588
Selalu menyelamatkanmu, huh?

675
01:08:33,612 --> 01:08:36,512
Kenapa kau lama sekali?

676
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:40,536
Kau tak apa-apa?
Kita harus pergi.

677
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,560
I thought Van Trach
had surely killed you.

678
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,584
He might as well have.

679
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:08,508
How did you find the strength?

680
01:09:12,532 --> 01:09:14,532
With every beat of my heart

681
01:09:16,556 --> 01:09:18,556
you were there
with me too, Arana.

682
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,580
You were my hope.

683
01:09:24,504 --> 01:09:28,504
There has not been a
single day when I don't regret.

684
01:09:29,528 --> 01:09:32,528
And ask God for forgivenes

685
01:09:34,552 --> 01:09:36,552
for leaving you.

686
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:43,576
My love.

687
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Seruni...

688
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:14,524
Van Trach.

689
01:10:32,548 --> 01:10:34,548
Dobrak!

690
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,572
Mereka sudah pergi.

691
01:10:55,596 --> 01:10:57,596
Come! Hurry.

692
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:59,620
Hide.

693
01:10:59,644 --> 01:11:01,644
Thank you.

694
01:11:03,568 --> 01:11:05,568
Uncle.

695
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:07,592
Suwo.

696
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:17,516
Are you all right?

697
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,540
You must be Jamar.

698
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:26,564
You have your father's eyes.

699
01:11:26,588 --> 01:11:28,588
You're that woman...

700
01:11:28,612 --> 01:11:30,612
at Van Trach house?

701
01:11:30,636 --> 01:11:31,636
It's OK, Jamar.

702
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:34,637
She's his wife?

703
01:11:34,661 --> 01:11:36,661
I am Seruni.

704
01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:38,685
Your uncle's wife.

705
01:11:41,509 --> 01:11:43,509
But we thought
you were... / Yes.

706
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,533
We all did, but...

707
01:11:47,557 --> 01:11:49,557
Seruni is alive.

708
01:11:55,581 --> 01:11:57,581
You look just like your mother.

709
01:12:00,505 --> 01:12:02,505
Aunty. / Yes, I'm your aunty.

710
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:05,529
Suwo.

711
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:08,553
I'll wait outside.

712
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,577
Be careful.

713
01:12:12,501 --> 01:12:14,501
Uncle...

714
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:16,525
Van Trach probably
knows we're here.

715
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:18,549
We should go. / Yes.

716
01:12:18,573 --> 01:12:20,573
We still have a
chance to kill him.

717
01:12:20,597 --> 01:12:23,597
To avenge our parents. /
Your father was a warrior

718
01:12:23,621 --> 01:12:25,621
but he fought for justice.

719
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:29,545
He would never let
his sons waste their live

720
01:12:29,569 --> 01:12:31,569
for the sake of vengeance.

721
01:12:31,593 --> 01:12:35,593
Have you forgotten? That day,
father set out to negotiate peace

722
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:39,517
but instead he was murdered.

723
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,541
Jamar, don't.

724
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:42,565
I won't be so foolish
to make the mistake.

725
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:44,589
Revenge is a right.

726
01:12:44,613 --> 01:12:46,613
He robbed us of our family.

727
01:12:46,637 --> 01:12:49,537
Revenge may be a right

728
01:12:50,561 --> 01:12:55,561
but forgiveness
makes you stronger.

729
01:12:55,585 --> 01:12:57,585
Jamar.

730
01:12:57,609 --> 01:12:59,609
I'm wrong.

731
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:02,533
Your father never
acted out of hatred.

732
01:13:03,557 --> 01:13:06,557
He always chose
to forgive, if he could.

733
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:10,581
If not for revenge,
then why are we here?

734
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:14,505
To serve justice.

735
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:18,529
For our people.

736
01:13:22,553 --> 01:13:24,553
Jamar...

737
01:13:24,577 --> 01:13:26,577
Halo.

738
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,601
Van Trach.

739
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:30,625
Aku melihat ada
reunian keluarga.

740
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:32,649
Kiona.

741
01:13:33,573 --> 01:13:35,573
Pasti kalian lagi berbahagia.

742
01:13:39,597 --> 01:13:41,597
Aku merasa agak lancang

743
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:43,621
bila aku tak ikut gabung
ke dalam perayaan reuni...

744
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,545
mengingat betapa
banyaknya... / Hey

745
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:48,569
keluarga kita sebenarnya.

746
01:13:49,593 --> 01:13:53,593
Maksudku, selama 20
tahun terakhir istrimu

747
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:55,617
telah tidur denganku, Arana.

748
01:13:55,641 --> 01:14:00,541
Banyak malam indah kuhabiskan
untuk memahami kesenangannya

749
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:02,565
dan penderitaannya.

750
01:14:04,589 --> 01:14:06,589
Lepaskan istriku, Arana...

751
01:14:07,513 --> 01:14:10,513
dan akan kubiarkan kalian
semua mati secara terhormat.

752
01:14:11,537 --> 01:14:13,537
We're surrounded.

753
01:14:16,561 --> 01:14:18,561
To die with you

754
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:21,585
would be my
greatest honor, Arana.

755
01:14:30,509 --> 01:14:32,509
Bakar rumah itu!

756
01:14:32,533 --> 01:14:33,533
Biar dia keluar.

757
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:35,557
Tembak mereka semua.

758
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:37,581
Semuanya.

759
01:14:38,505 --> 01:14:40,505
Let me go.

760
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:42,529
Seruni?

761
01:14:42,553 --> 01:14:44,553
Dia telah membuat pilihan.

762
01:14:44,577 --> 01:14:46,577
Dia akan terbakar
bersama mereka semua.

763
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:57,501
Animals! Get back.

764
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:03,525
Stay down.

765
01:15:10,549 --> 01:15:11,549
Suwo.

766
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,573
Everyone all right?

767
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,597
Uncle!

768
01:15:16,621 --> 01:15:18,621
Arana.

769
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:38,545
Jamar, we can use
the smoke to escape.

770
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,569
What? / Clear the way first.

771
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:42,593
Are you mad? /
You clear the way.

772
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:44,617
I'll help uncle.

773
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,941
No way, we have
to stay as a group.

774
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,542
Please trust me. I will
bring them out in one piece.

775
01:15:56,566 --> 01:15:58,566
Berjanjilah, kau akan
keluarkan mereka.

776
01:15:58,590 --> 01:16:00,590
Kami berada di belakangmu.

777
01:16:00,614 --> 01:16:01,614
Percayalah.

778
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:03,638
Ayo!

779
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,562
Cepat!

780
01:16:11,586 --> 01:16:13,586
Uncle, we need to
cover your wound.

781
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,610
Bear with it, Uncle. /
It's just a scratch, Suwo.

782
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:17,634
Just bear with the
pain for a while.

783
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:19,558
Suwo,

784
01:16:19,582 --> 01:16:22,582
our time together is at an end.

785
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:25,506
No. / It is time

786
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:27,530
for you to take hold
of your own destiny.

787
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:30,554
I'm not leaving you two behind.

788
01:16:30,578 --> 01:16:32,578
Indeed you aren't

789
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:35,502
because I'm the
one who has to leave.

790
01:16:40,526 --> 01:16:43,526
I have always loved you

791
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,550
and Jamar

792
01:16:45,574 --> 01:16:47,574
as my own sons.

793
01:16:48,598 --> 01:16:50,598
Your father will be so
proud of both of you.

794
01:16:50,622 --> 01:16:53,522
I'm sure that's what he'll said

795
01:16:53,546 --> 01:16:56,546
when the wind
carries me to meet him.

796
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,570
Don't worry, Suwo.

797
01:17:00,594 --> 01:17:02,594
I'm very much at peace.

798
01:17:07,518 --> 01:17:10,518
It is time for you to leave now.

799
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,542
Jamar is waiting for you.

800
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:17,566
Go.

801
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:51,590
Dimana mereka?
/ Mereka tak ikut.

802
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:57,514
Apa maksudmu?

803
01:19:57,538 --> 01:19:59,538
Mereka sudah tiada.

804
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:03,562
Kau menyuruhku...
untuk pergi duluan...

805
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:07,586
dan kalian akan
berada di belakangku.

806
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:09,610
Aku sudah berusaha. / Kau
suruh aku mempercayaimu.

807
01:20:10,534 --> 01:20:12,534
Katakan sesuatu!

808
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:14,558
Ini tak adil. / Adil?

809
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:17,582
Kau mau tahu apa
itu ketidakadilan?

810
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:21,506
Paman mati gara-gara dirimu.

811
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,530
Kau meninggalkan
paman untuk mati.

812
01:20:28,554 --> 01:20:30,554
Masa bodoh!

813
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,578
Hanya dirimulah
satu-satunya keluargaku.

814
01:24:14,502 --> 01:24:16,502
Maaf.

815
01:24:38,526 --> 01:24:40,526
Paman menyuruhku menyampaikan
pesan bahwa dia menyesal.

816
01:24:40,550 --> 01:24:43,550
Sekarang dia pasti
sedang mengawasi kita

817
01:24:43,574 --> 01:24:46,574
bersama ayah.

818
01:24:47,598 --> 01:24:49,598
Dan apapun rencana
kita selanjutnya...

819
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,522
kita lakukan demi rakyat.

820
01:24:54,546 --> 01:24:56,546
Rakyat kita.

821
01:24:57,570 --> 01:24:59,570
Come on. Go.

822
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,594
Go!

823
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:05,518
Kami tak menemukan mayat mereka.

824
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,542
Pikiranmu apa sama denganku?

825
01:26:13,566 --> 01:26:17,566
Aku mulai bosan
melihat orang digantung.

826
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,590
Itu kelamaan.

827
01:26:22,514 --> 01:26:25,514
Cowok-cowokmu akan terlambat.

828
01:26:32,538 --> 01:26:34,538
Sir, our guests have arrive.

829
01:26:34,562 --> 01:26:36,562
Yah, apes aku.

830
01:26:37,586 --> 01:26:39,586
Dan tepat waktu.

831
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:42,510
Tutup gerbangnya!

832
01:26:42,534 --> 01:26:44,534
Tembak mati mereka.

833
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:41,558
Kau siap? / Selalu siap.

834
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:50,582
Kurasa mereka ingin
berhadapan langsung.

835
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:42,506
Van Trach, let's make a deal.

836
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:43,530
Kesepakatan?

837
01:28:43,554 --> 01:28:46,554
Take your men, leave this place

838
01:28:46,578 --> 01:28:48,578
and don't ever return.

839
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:54,502
Seperti yang kalian lihat, kami
semua cukup nyaman disini.

840
01:28:54,526 --> 01:28:55,526
Oh?

841
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:59,550
In that case, be prepared
to face judgement.

842
01:28:59,574 --> 01:29:03,574
Memang siapa kalian?
Cowboy dari Tanah Barat?

843
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:06,598
Cowboys mengendarai kuda

844
01:29:06,622 --> 01:29:08,622
bukan kerbau.

845
01:29:09,546 --> 01:29:11,546
Dan jika aku tak bisa
sebut kalian Cowboys

846
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,570
maka kupanggil saja
kalian Buffalo Boys.

847
01:29:18,594 --> 01:29:20,594
So what's it going to be...

848
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:22,618
war or peace?

849
01:29:22,642 --> 01:29:25,542
Kurasa ini yang
mereka sebut berunding.

850
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,566
Tembakkan meriam!

851
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,590
Suwo!

852
01:34:22,514 --> 01:34:24,514
Jamar!

853
01:34:24,538 --> 01:34:26,538
Jamar, tidak, tidak, tidak.

854
01:34:43,562 --> 01:34:45,562
Hm.

855
01:34:47,586 --> 01:34:49,586
I'll give you one bullet.

856
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:57,510
What are you going to do?

857
01:35:36,534 --> 01:35:39,534
Kalian cuma cari mampus

858
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:42,558
kemari.

859
01:36:01,582 --> 01:36:03,582
Kau tangguh juga, brengsek.

860
01:36:31,506 --> 01:36:33,506
Are you ready?

861
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,530
All ready.

862
01:36:35,554 --> 01:36:37,554
Hey.

863
01:36:39,578 --> 01:36:42,578
Uncle was right. This
dagger saved my life.

864
01:36:43,502 --> 01:36:45,502
Look, this is where
the bullet bounced off it.

865
01:36:53,526 --> 01:36:55,526
I'll get the horses ready.

866
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:06,550
I know that you must leave.

867
01:37:06,574 --> 01:37:08,574
So must we.

868
01:37:09,598 --> 01:37:11,598
They will be back
for more blood.

869
01:37:16,522 --> 01:37:18,522
We'll meet again

870
01:37:19,546 --> 01:37:21,546
when the time is right.

871
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:33,570
Tell the rest of our people

872
01:37:33,594 --> 01:37:35,594
that there's still hope.

873
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:38,518
And there are still people
who are willing to fight

874
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:40,542
for justice.

875
01:38:03,566 --> 01:38:04,566
Hey.

876
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,590
This belong to my uncle.

877
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:08,614
Arana.

878
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:11,538
And now it's yours.
Take care of it, yeah.

879
01:38:11,562 --> 01:38:13,562
Yes.

880
01:38:14,586 --> 01:38:16,586
Thank you.

881
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:18,610
We'll never forget you.

882
01:38:18,634 --> 01:38:20,634
Hm.

883
01:38:31,558 --> 01:38:33,558
We'll meet them again.

884
01:38:35,582 --> 01:38:36,582
What?

885
01:38:36,606 --> 01:38:38,606
How are you so sure?

886
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,530
Because when the
legends are born

887
01:38:43,554 --> 01:38:45,554
they will never die.

888
01:38:47,578 --> 01:38:57,578
