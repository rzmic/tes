16
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,851
have ye spotted any
pirate ships off the coast?

17
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,506
That'’s a negative, Captain,
but I think we'’re getting close.

18
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,509
Hey bud, you wanna hit us with
another of those trivia questions?

19
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:20,728
Yeah, let'’s do that again.

00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:21,990
Okay...

21
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,122
- Fun fact 32.
- Oh, God.

Hey. Stop it.

Ooh, wait. I think
I know this one.

26
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,608
Honey, are there
any easy questions?

27
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,306
Or even better, how about
we play something else?

28
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,222
I'’m already sick of this place
and we'’re not even there yet.

on. Salmon. Salmon.

I know that there'’s
no salmon in the Baja.

31
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,271
I'’ll say a dorkfish.

32
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,882
Hey Tommy, is it a dorkfish?

33
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,755
Maybe... or could be
a red-lipped batfish!

34
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,234
- Oh, could it?
- Yes, it could.

Duh? Duh?

00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,982
What, are you getting
snippy with us, pal?

40
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,723
So he'’s allowed to say "duh"?

41
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,464
I used to get in trouble
for that. Audrey--

42
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,248
Nobody'’s allowed to
say "duh."That'’s so unfair.

43
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,815
Baby, baby... I
don'’t like "duh."

51
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,748
Bahia was our first getaway as
a couple before we were married.

52
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:25,836
Yes, it was.

53
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,664
Whoa, I'’m gonna yak.

54
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,318
Your daddy was so
romantic back then.

55
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:30,928
- I still am.
- No, you'’re not.

56
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,930
How long ago was that?

57
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:36,151
Well, your sister just turned
15, so it was 15 years ago.

58
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,239
And nine months.

59
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:38,588
Exactly.

60
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,114
Ew!

61
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,118
You were quite a
shock to us too, sweetie.

62
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,859
Oh, I feel so special now.

63
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,427
Hey, hey, hey. You are special.

64
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,863
Wait, what?

65
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,865
Anyway...

66
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,956
Bahia was where I landed my
first installation gig with Nixon Oil.

67
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,784
Boring.

68
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,744
No, it'’s not boring,
because after that...

69
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,789
...financially, I knew

70
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,444
that I would be able
to support a family

71
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,664
and marry the woman that I love.

72
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,796
You mean, marry the
woman you got pregnant?

73
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,016
- Oh, burn!
- Hey, yeah, stop it!

74
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,321
- Endless.
- Stop it. Yeah.

75
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,846
- Why do we have kids?
- I have no idea.

76
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,804
I just hope we
get to see pirates.

77
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,458
Pirates are lame, Tommy.

78
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:24,460
You'’re one to talk.

79
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,593
The only pirate you know is the
one on the bottle of Captain Morgan.

80
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,724
- Shut up, Tommy!
- Tommy!

81
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,160
- Audrey!
- That'’s not true!

82
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,727
- Let'’s hope so.
- What do you mean by that?

83
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,034
- What does he mean by that?
- Tommy... He'’s lying.

84
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,297
You'’re only 15. What do you
know about Captain Morgan?

85
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,428
You'’re such a liar, Tommy.

86
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,914
Dad, I think I
see it. Is that it?

87
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,438
Yep, buddy. That'’s
her. El Diamante.

88
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,962
Are you gonna decompose it?

89
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,182
Decommission, genius.

90
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,184
I don'’t know, buddy.

91
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:56,057
It all depends on if
she passes, you know,

92
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,321
safety measures, system
functionality, refinery quotas.

93
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:02,803
Oh, do you want him - to try that again in English?
- Oh, Audrey.

94
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:06,197
I will only decommission
a rig like El Diamante

95
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,678
if we can'’t resuscitate
her. It'’s kind of like--

96
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,898
Pulling the plug.

97
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,640
Dad should decommission you!

98
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,119
And I should pull your plug!

99
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:16,294
No, you wouldn'’t.

100
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:17,600
Shut up.

101
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,612
Hey, were you able
to get an ocean view?

102
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,355
Paul... You did book, right?

103
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,183
Baby, that hotel'’s
never gonna be full.

104
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,187
Ooh, Dad'’s in trouble. Tommy...

105
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,582
Hey, I don'’t know. I just thought it
would be nice to stay at that same place.

106
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,801
Hey, uh, where is this anyway?

107
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:48,457
Costa Azul. Nicest
hotel in town.

108
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,199
They make a mean <i>callo
de hacha. Aye verdad.</i>

109
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,637
Pair it with a cold margarita
and you got yourself a happy wife.

110
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,291
I want nachos.

111
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:06,257
You know, actually, I think there was a
good little hotel restaurant right up here.

112
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:11,828
Yeah, Dad. Looks
amazing. Great choice.

113
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:14,396
I wonder what
happened to it? Mmm.

114
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:08,276
Uh-huh. Nicest hotel
in town? Really, Dad?

115
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,409
A lot has changed since
the last time we were here.

116
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,411
It definitely ain'’t full.

117
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:16,284
No kidding. I guess I should
have called, huh? Yeah.

118
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,331
Senor, hello. Uh, excuse
me. Do you speak English?

119
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,031
Sir, do you speak English?

120
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,862
He doesn'’t speak English.

121
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,474
No?

122
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:39,655
<i>De hecho,</i> he doesn'’t
speak anything at all.

123
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,964
You'’re a long way
from home, gringo.

124
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,577
Man, I'’m just down here
for a weekend with my family.

125
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:52,668
Families don'’t just come
here for the weekend.

126
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,457
Yes.

127
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,938
Yeah, I work for Nixon Oil.
I'’m sure you'’ve heard of us.

128
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,810
I mean, we practically
built this place.

129
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,259
Take a look around, <i>cabrón.</i>

130

134
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:22,644
Whoa.

135
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,560
What is it?

136
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,258
Who cares? Just keep walking.

137
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,521
I never noticed it before.

138
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:33,089
Tlaloc. The Aztec god.

00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,136
Why is it here?

140
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,508

141
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,859

00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,383

144
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:07,732
Tommy.

145
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,518
Come on. You gotta stay with us.

146
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>Gracias.</i>

147
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,158
Oh, by the way, back there
when you said... protection.

148
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,031
What'’d you mean?
Protection from what?

00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:56,912
This for you.

153
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,009
That was a very

154
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:10,012
God, I can'’t believe you'’d
share your pirate patch with him.

155
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,405
That'’s fantastic.

156

<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

No, no, no. I-- I
get it. It'’s the boss.

158
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,503
All right, I will

00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,071

- All right, bye.
- Okay, guys.

161
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,858
We'’re gonna have to
figure out something else

162
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:32,469
because we'’re not gonna
stay in this town. Aw, man.

163
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,384
Who was that, honey?

164
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:36,647
The company.

165
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,955
For some reason, they'’re on my back
to get this inspection done immediately.

166
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,088
NRT is up our ass.

167
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:45,047
So, look, I'’ll ferry out to the
Diamante, I'’ll do the inspection.

168
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,918
While I'’m out there,

169
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,748
you book us someplace else in
Ensenada, someplace nice. Okay?

170
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,881
- Yeah.
- I'’ll be back before sunset.

171
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,101
And you'’re leaving us here?

172
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,190
Here?

173
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,105
What are we supposed
to do in the meantime?

174
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,455
Oh, what are we supposed
to do in the meantime?

175
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,630
Oh, my-- No, no, no, no.

176
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:03,805
Guys... Don'’t.

177
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,111
Guys.

178
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,287
I will only be gone
a few hours, okay?

179
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,332
Are you sure about this, honey?

180
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,248
The sooner I go, the sooner
we can get out of this place.

181
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,381
And how are you gonna get there?

182
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,036
Uh, the company says I got a boat
waitin'’ for me down in the harbor.

183
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,907
Cool. Can I go with you?

184
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,735
No.

185
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:25,827
Sorry, little man, you are not
quite tall enough for this ride.

186
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,443
- Hey.
- Hmm?

187
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:36,098
- Trust me. Okay?
- Mmm.

188
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,361
Besides, Mom, I'’m pretty
sure people around here

189
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:39,928
have bigger problems
than worrying about us.

190
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,060
Really?

191
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,626
What is that supposed to mean?

192
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,585
"Taloc."

193
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,369
T-la-la-loc.

194
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,588
It'’s Tlaloc, guys.

195
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,459
- Yeah.
- It'’s not that hard.

196
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,505
The creepy god
painted everywhere?

197
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,811
Maybe that'’s why the
villagers are so quiet.

198
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,422
That is just part
of their culture.

199
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,337
And besides, little man,

200
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,340
pirates back in the day
did not have Internet,

201
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,603
so why don'’t we put
this away for a while

202
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,649
and you try being a real
pirate. <i>Sí...</i> That'’s a great idea.

203
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,564
Aye, aye, Captain.

204
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,349
I'’ll consider it.

205
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:15,006
Hmm. Yeah, we'’re
gonna be fine. But hurry.

206
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,573
- Bye, Dad.
- Be nice.

207
00:18:16,747 --> 00:18:18,271
Fine. Okay.

208
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:21,404
In the meantime, we are
going to enjoy the view. Hmm?

209
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,190
You speak English?

210
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,582
A little.

211
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,758
Do me a favor.

212
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:30,065
Keep an eye on my
family for me, would you?

213
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,156
<i>Gracias.</i>

214
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,335
Audrey, it'’s only-- Can I?

215
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,207
No. - I'’ll give it to you later.
- Okay, fine.

216
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,268
<i>Hola. Buenos días.</i>

217
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,314
Uh, my name is
Paul. Paul Sturges.

218
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:04,273
I'’m with, um-- - I'’m with Nixon Oil.
- Ah! <i>Sí.</i>

219
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,362
I'’m supposed to ferry
out to the rig from here?

220
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,104
Yes. Uh, Choco'’s at the shore.

221
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,498
Waiting for you. Right there.

222
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,109
Right. Uh, hey, do me a favor.

223
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,764
Radio out to the rig, - let '’em know I'’m on my way.
- Absolutely.

224
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:17,895
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

225
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,114
Welcome.

226
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,304
<i>Hola!</i>

227
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:37,959
<i>Hola, amigo!</i>

228
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,615
Paul Sturges. Nixon Oil.

229
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,095
Yeah, I think you took me out
to the rig a few years ago. Right?

230
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,575
<i>Sí, señor.</i> Let'’s get going.

231
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,360
I want to get back
before sunset.

232
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:48,796
Okay.

233
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,585
- Got it?
- I'’m waiting for the wave.

234
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,376
So, what happened here?

235
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:05,769
What do you mean, sir?

236
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,685
What do I mean? I mean...

237
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,861
where are all the boats?
Where'’d all the fishermen go?

238
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,428
Where'’d all the people
who live here go?

239
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:15,997
Things...

240
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,043
very bad, sir.

241
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,568
What-- What do you
mean, things are very bad?

242
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,138
El Diamante...

243
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,362
<i>El Demonio.</i>

244
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,583
The Demon.

245
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:39,238
Okay.

246
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey, I'’m confused. Why
are we stopping again?

247
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,221
Sorry, sir.

248
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,791
I can'’t go past here.

249
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:11,966
Why not?

250
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,272
Bad vibes.

251
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,491
- Bad vibes?
- Yeah.

252
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,363
Look, Cho-- Choco, if
it'’s more money you need,

253
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:19,190
- I got money.
- No, no, sir.

254
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,018
I-- I can'’t.

255
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,629
But the boat'’s ready.

256
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,326
I check everything.

257
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,067
Engine is strong like a bull.

258
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,983
Look.

259
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:32,073
See? Pepe is waiting
for you on the rig.

260
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,294
Yeah, I know Pepe.

261
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,121
He knows everything.

262
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,427
He'’s a good man.

263
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,909
You call when ready.

264
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,911
You know there'’s no
cell service out here, right?

265
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,826
<i>Sí,</i> but you call on radio.

266
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,524
Forget it. I'’ll-- I'’ll
get myself back.

267
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:50,657
Thanks for nothing.

268
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:51,962
You'’re welcome.

269
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,243
"'’Taloc'’ is the god of rain.

270
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,985
His name means
the nectar of the earth.

271
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,902
He'’s one of the oldest and most
formidable gods of the Aztec pantheon,

272
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,731
dating back 2,500 years ago.

273
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:25,822
He was the benevolent
giver of life and water.

274
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,477
But he was also greatly feared.

275
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:32,133
He could stop the rain and
provoke drought and hunger.

276
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,570
He could hurl the
lightning upon the earth

277
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,051
and unleash
devastating hurricanes.

278
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:39,488
They even named a
mountain after '’Taloc.'’"

279
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,360
It'’s Tlaloc, baby.

280
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,145
Something'’s off.

281
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,103
What is it that I'’m
not getting here?

282
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,888
There'’s no birds.

283
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,282
"He was the ruler
of the third sun,"

284
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,851
and this other guy whose name
I won'’t even try to pronounce

285
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,071
stole his girlfriend.

286
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:59,073
"Then afterwards,
he became so angry

287
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,771
that he ignored
everyone'’s prayers for rain."

288
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,470
Wicked.

289
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,211
No. Jerk move.

290
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,127
Kinda like how Ross
cheated on Rachel.

291
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,392
He didn'’t cheat on
her. They were on break.

292
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,483
I need to use the bathroom.

293
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,136
Make it quick, okay?

294
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,358
Boy, that kid'’s impressionable.

295
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,493
Are you fighting because
of Rachel and Ross?

296
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,758
Ah, okay, enough of this.

297
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,763
Ugh, can you do it? All right.

298
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,194
Mom?

299
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,242
Audrey! Behind me!

300
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,461
Come.

301
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,944
Tommy! Here.

302
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,556
- Stay here.
- Stay with me. Tommy. Here.

303
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,305
Run!

304
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,358
Uh, Mom?

305
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:58,061
Audrey? Audrey, run!

306
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,110
Uh, Mom?

307
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,461
Mom? Mom, I think
we'’re being followed.

308
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:09,551
Ignore them, Audrey. No one
is allowed to assault you ever.

309
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:12,467
Not even disrespect you,
okay? And that goes for you, too.

310
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,513
I'’m gonna get us
out of here. I promise.

311
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,955
<i>Sí, El Diamante.</i>

312
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:24,784
Mom?

313
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,439
Mom!

314
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:29,919
I got this, baby, okay?

315
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,928
<i>Muchas gracias.</i> Thank you.

316
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,864
Jesus, where is everyone?

317
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:02,925
Hello?

318
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,149
Pepe?

319
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:16,983
Anybody?

320
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,471
What the hell is this?

321
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,301
Hey, Pepe!

322
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:36,219
Corporate'’s not
gonna go for this.

323
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:39,788
Hello?

324
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,881
Pepe!

325
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,973
<i>Hola, Pepe!</i>

326
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,020
Hello? Pepe?

327
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,242
Pepe.

328
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,595
Is there anyone here?

329
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,691
Pepe?

330
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:23,571
Aw, hey, girl, you
here all alone?

331
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,530
No, <i>señor.</i> No, he'’s not.

332
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,403
Take it easy with that.
I'’m just looking for Pepe.

333
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,100
Pepe is dead.

334
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:32,841
Who are you <i>cabrón?</i>

335
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,626
My name is Paul Sturges.
I'’m-- I'’m with Nixon Oil.

336
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,890
What'’s going on here?

337
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,153
Didn'’t the harbor master tell
you guys I was on my way?

338
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,460
No.

339
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,072
Our radio is dead.

340
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,987
I never thought I'’d see a
guy from the company again.

341
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,859
I-- I-- I'’m just here
to do the inspection.

342
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,382
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

343
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,124
Yeah. Little late, huh, <i>guero?</i>

344
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,343
You alone?

345
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:59,694
Yeah. Yeah, of
course I'’m alone.

346
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,609
Where the hell is everyone?

347
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,655
- How'’d you get here?
- Shh.

348
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,876
The-- The little motorboat.

349
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,533
<i>Chinga.</i>

350
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,932
<i>Chinga? Chinga</i> what?

351
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,245
A family? Let me see.

352
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,684
Yes, what the hell?

353
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,788
Hey, Tommy, get away
from the edge, okay?

354
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,792
Mom, what'’s that?

355
00:29:58,622 --> 00:29:59,536
Did you not hear me?

356
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,190
Mom?

357
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,809
What are you doing?

358
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,074
What-- Why are you
doing that? Stop doing that!

359
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,945
What the--

360
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,773
There'’s Dad and
some other guys.

361
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,296
Is he?

362
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:22,821
What is happening?

363
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,303
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

364
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:31,133
- Mom, what'’s going on?
- I don'’t know, baby. But hold tight. Hold tight!

365
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:32,874
Where is that coming from?

366
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,223
- That'’s where!
- What?

367
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:40,708
Whoa!

368
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,753
Are you okay, guys? Keep
your hands in the boat.

369
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,110
Go with Daddy. Go with Daddy.

370
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,678
What'’s happening, babe?

371
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,463
Babe, what are you
doing? Why are you here?

372
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,508
What is that?

373
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,947
Pa?

374
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,470
- Why are you here?
- We couldn'’t stay there, okay?

375
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,446
There were-- were. The body!
There'’s bodies! All of them dead!

376
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,622
There are-- there were-- Hey,
hey. There'’s nothing there.

377
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,276
- There'’s nothing there.
- Just breathe.

378
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,017
But there were-- But I
saw--Baby, you'’re fine.

379
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:30,627
- Just breathe.
- But I saw all of them.

380
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,325
It'’s just oil. It'’s okay.

381
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:33,892
All right, let'’s get her
cleaned up and dried off.

382
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:35,154
You'’re okay.
- You'’re okay. - Got her?

383
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,895
- Here, Tommy.
- Lets get you dry.

384
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,592
Get you dry and
cleaned up, okay?

385
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:43,292
I'’ll be right there
with you, okay?

386
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,860
- What is happening here?
- What'’s happening?

387
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,253
- What made the boat sink?
- Why did he leave?

388
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:48,602
- What is going on?
- Why did he leave?

389
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,691
- What did she see?
- What did she see, huh?

390
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:53,389
- You don'’t wanna know.
- No, we do wanna know. What'’s happening?

391
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,652
What is it?

392
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,972
What is that?

393
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,814
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

394
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,036
Jesus Christ.

395
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:32,733
No.

396
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,604
The Black Demon.

397
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:36,998
Where are my kids?

398
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,378
<i>Gracias.</i>

399
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,953
Hey. Careful, it'’s hot.

400
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,394
Baby, here.

401
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,008
Hey, I wasn'’t mad at
you back there, okay?

402
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,449
Don'’t try to
understand it, <i>guero.</i>

403
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:23,844
Just accept that
it'’s real and alive.

404
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,369
How long has that
thing been out there?

405
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,458
I don'’t know.

406
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,808
I'’ve lost track of time.

407
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:37,814
<i>Me llamo Chato.</i>

408
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,254
Chato.

409
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,300
And where'’s the
rest of the crew?

410
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:48,564
Gone. Some managed to evacuate.

411
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:51,350
Others, not so lucky.

412
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,092
Me and Junior, we were the
only ones smart enough to stay.

413
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,659
Smart enough?

414
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:58,792
Paul?

415
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,882
I-- I-- I can'’t get any signal.

416
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,188
There'’s no signal.

417
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,928
There'’s no service.

418
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,107
What'’s going on?
What'’s that thing we saw?

419
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,283
I don'’t know.

420
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,415
Oh, that poor man.

421
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,678
I ask him to come here
and I treat him like shit.

422
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,986
No, no, baby. Hey,
listen to me. Listen to me.

423
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,250
It'’s not your fault. You couldn'’t
have known. None of us could.

424
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,253
What is that then?

425
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:28,256
Some kind of shark.

426
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,563
It'’s not a shark.

427
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,696
It'’s a megalodon.

428
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,264
Those don'’t exist.

429
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:39,137
Guys, I told you to stay inside.
What are you doing here?

430
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,313
Hey, look. There must be
some other way off this rig.

431
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,315
Do you think we'’d
be here if there was?

432
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,231
Radio stopped working weeks
ago. Our calls went ignored.

433
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,189
- Ignored?
- Ignored? What do you mean?

434
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,583
What-- What about - the satellite phone?
- It was taken with the crew.

435
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:52,976
Look. If you'’re gonna ask
me questions about boats,

436
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,501
phones or some other way
of getting off this damn rig,

437
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,938
then we'’re gonna be
here for a long time.

438
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,157
Who'’s this little guy?

439
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,246
That'’s Toro.

440
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,161
Tough name for a little dog.

441
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,382
Don'’t look him in the eye then.

442
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,043
What? Do you
think I made that up?

443
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,918
Guess he'’s not that
tough after all, huh?

444
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:25,226
What was that?

445
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,706
That'’s coming from
the southern leg.

446
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,098
It'’s trying to
bring the rig down.

447
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,665
The southern leg
holds the auxiliary line.

448
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,364
Ines, get the kids downstairs
and inside, all right?

449
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:34,409
I'’m going to - figure this out.
- Okay.

450
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,106
Where? We'’re going inside.

451
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,065
What exactly are
your jobs on the rig?

452
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,502
I do whatever is needed.

453
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:43,375
Me and my <i>carnal</i> are trying to keep this
hunk of shit from falling into the ocean.

454
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,985
Hunk of shit is
putting it mildly.

455
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,466
All right, give me a complete
rundown on Diamante.

456
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,643
Control room, electrical,
standard satellite, the whole thing.

457
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,646
Rundown? Nothing
works. That'’s your rundown.

458
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,082
Nothing works.

459
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,781
And how often does
this thing hit the rig?

460
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:01,654
<i>El Demonio</i> attacks
when it wants.

461
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:03,438
- What about the volume?
- Zero.

462
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:06,049
Spillage has been nonstop - for the past few months.
- Zero?

463
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,576
Are you shitting me? This thing
has been leaking this bad for months?

464
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:14,797
All those <i>pendejos</i> at
Nixon Oil knew all about it.

465
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:17,539
We just wondered why you guys
never sent the resources to fix it.

466
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,280
That'’s absurd.

467
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:22,370
Does all this damage look
absurd to you, <i>guero?</i> Huh?

468
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:24,807
Let me tell you something.
We grew up here.

469
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,898
So when we heard about
all these <i>pinches problemas</i>

470
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:31,205
this place was having,
we transferred back.

471
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:33,468
To see all this? No.

472
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:35,731
I'’m sorry, man.

473
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,257
If we live through this,

474
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,694
I'’m gonna gather up all of
them bigwig son of a bitches

475
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,435
and feed their <i>huevos</i> to Toro.

476
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:50,877
Jesus.

477
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,705
Yeah, support'’s been fractured.

478
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,794
I don'’t think it can take
much more punishment.

479
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:58,188
No, it'’s fine. She'’s designed
to withstand a category five.

480
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,760
Does that feel like a
category five, <i>guero?</i>

481
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,458
The auxiliary is still working.

482
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,376
There goes the auxiliary.

483
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:13,856
<i>Chinga.</i>

484
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,902
What now?

485
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,167
We need power.

486
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,779
Without the auxiliary line, the
backup generator won'’t work.

487
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,912
Where is it? This line.

488
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,001
This line. This line here.

489
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:31,657
Then I can repair and reroute
the radio, and we can call for help.

490
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,746
You mean dive?

491
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,358
Is the dive bell
still functional?

492
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,490
- Simón.
- Yeah?

493
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:43,233
Dad. Carnaroni?

494
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:46,672
Yeah, bud. That'’s
what they eat down here.

495
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:49,370
Well, they'’re not my
<i>abuelita'’s</i> enchiladas, but...

496
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,980
...they'’ll keep you full.

497
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:52,765
Hey, we'’re much
better, <i>verdad, mi amor?</i>

498
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:54,941
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

499
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:58,248
So, listen. I think I found a way to
fix the radio and get us out of here.

500
00:38:58,423 --> 00:38:59,815
- What?
- Okay.

501
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,427
- So, we have a plan, right?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

502
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:06,605
Why don'’t we open this window so we
can lighten up this place? Help me there.

503
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,868
If the auxiliary line
can be repaired,

504
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,131
we'’re gonna have to do
some work down there.

505
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,785
You know how to weld?

506
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:14,569
A-- A bit. Yeah.

507
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:17,224
A bit? It'’s okay.

508
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,357
We'’ll go down. You stay up top.

509
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,184
We'’ll be faster.

510
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,100
I'’ll prep the-- the tanks.

511
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,277
All right, so I'’ll retract
you down in the bell.

512
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:28,888
You fix the line.

513
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,672
Hey, wait. You aren'’t
actually going down there?

514
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:32,805
Did you just forget about
the 70-ton shark out there?

515
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:36,156
Babe, the bell on this rig is
made of thick fine-grained steel.

516
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,159
I'’d like to see that son
of a bitch bite down on it.

517
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,552
- It'’ll be fine.
- Paul...

518
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:43,119
It'’ll be fine. Hey, kids.

519
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:45,470
There'’s a chess board,
some books and games.

520
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:47,036
If you want to use them--

521
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,952
We are not exactly trying
to get comfortable here!

522
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:51,258
I'’m sorry, I--

523
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,957
So-- Actually--
Actually, it'’s a great idea.

524
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:58,221
Why would a shark be
so interested in an oil rig?

525
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,397
Well...

526
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:02,835
your company...

527
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,359
this rig, was to provide jobs.

528
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,144
A better future for Bahia Azul.

529
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,235
And it did, at first,

530
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:17,676
until regulation standards started
getting more and more overlooked.

531
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,332
Nobody gave a shit. Nobody.

532
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:27,816
You know, this is
not just any shark.

533
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,731
Not just a megalodon.

534
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,647
What is it then?

535
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,302
It'’s much more than that.

536
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,392
It'’s a curse.

537
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:44,224
Curse? Come on, man.
Now'’s not the time for this.

538
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,574
Paul, let him talk. Please.

539
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,707
<i>El Demonio</i> is an extension.

540
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:52,841
It'’s the vengeance
of an old god.

541
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,104
You know, when I was a-- a boy,

542
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,194
my <i>abuelito</i> would always tell
me stories about the god of rain.

543
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,369
"Taloc."

544
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,719
Tlaloc.

545
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,329
Hey, baby, <i>ven.</i>

546
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,810
<i>Mi abuelito</i> would
always remind me

547
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:07,073
that Tlaloc was
not just any god.

548
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,728
He was a giver of life.

549
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:13,427
That his tears made the
oceans, the lakes, <i>ríos.</i>

550
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,385
And that most importantly,

551
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,605
we only prayed for
what was needed.

552
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:19,346
Never more.

553
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,306
Thousands of years
ago, that was not the case.

554
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,092
A great flood came through.

555
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:29,399
A flood brought
on not by nature,

556
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:31,663
but by wrath.

557
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,403
Wrath?

558
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,843
You know, people took too much.

559
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:40,410
They chopped down all the trees.

560
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,500
Instead of just taking
what they needed to eat,

561
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,632
they killed-- they
killed all the animals.

562
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:47,330
And they tried to control
the rivers and the lakes.

563
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,464
They thought they
were in control.

564
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:52,945
We thought we were the gods.

565
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:55,817
That'’s what pissed him off.

566
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,994
And Tlaloc'’s
warning went ignored.

567
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:02,476
Until <i>El Demonio Negro</i> was born.

568
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,912
Here we go.

569
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,480
Brought out of extinction
by Tlaloc himself.

570
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:10,353
You see, that was
no ordinary meg.

571
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,966
Makes you see things,
plays games with your mind.

572
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,577
Please. You don'’t believe me?

573
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,623
Let'’s ask your daughter
what she saw. Let'’s ask her.

574
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:19,798
Hey. Hey, hey.

575
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:21,495
What did you see, Paul?

576
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:27,849
We are destroying
Tlaloc'’s world.

577
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:30,939
And now the demon has
come back to protect it.

578
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,506
How are we gonna stop it?

579
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,552
The only way to
stop it is to kill it.

580
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,424
But killing the demon
is not gonna stop Tlaloc.

581
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,252
He'’s gonna keep
getting his revenge

582
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,559
until an ultimate
sacrifice has been made.

583
00:42:42,298 --> 00:42:43,430
Now, you'’ve seen it.

584
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:46,215
This entire place
is a wasteland.

585
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:49,654
And everything that
was sacred or gave us life

586
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,352
has been killed.

587
00:42:53,005 --> 00:42:54,310
It'’s "Taloc."

588
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,399
That'’s why it was so
dusty back in Bahia.

589
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,184
"Taloc" won'’t let it rain.

590
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,101
It'’s Tla-loc.

591
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,844
Tla... loc.

592
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:07,976
Tla...

593
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:10,152
Ta... Tla...

594
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,807
Ta... T-la...

595
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,026
Tla...

596
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,723
- Loc.
- Tlaloc.

597
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:20,685
What'’s that?

598
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,600
Hmm.

599
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,691
<i>Gracias.</i>

600
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:29,041
Tlaloc. Tlaloc.

601
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:32,174
Enough! So, that'’s your answer?

602
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:34,568
Everything that'’s gone wrong - with this world?
- Paul...

603
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:38,050
No, no, no. Come on, man.
Angry gods? Ultimate sacrifice?

604
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:40,052
- Paul, will you please stop?
- No. No. No.

605
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,967
I'’m not gonna sit
here and listen to him

606
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,752
fill our children'’s heads
with superstitious nonsense.

607
00:43:44,926 --> 00:43:46,885
They have enough to worry
about as it is, for Chrissake.

608
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,061
Open your eyes, <i>cabrón.</i>

609
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,802
We are destroying
our own planet.

610
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,026
We gotta do this
now. We gotta do this.

611
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,379
Hey.

612
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:06,644
No, no, no, no, no. Don'’t you--

613
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,820
Do not listen to
what he'’s saying.

614
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,212
He'’s gone crazy.

615
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,258
Are you sure about that?

616
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:15,130
Baby, we can'’t exactly
deny what we'’re dealing with.

617
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:18,133
There is a giant shark
out there, and you saw it!

618
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:23,269
Paul...

619
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:35,020
Bell'’s on battery!

620
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:45,552
What do you think? Lowering it manually
should make it much brighter down below.

621
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,946
So, you do believe it'’s Tlaloc?

622
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,123
No. But I know a big-ass
shark when I see one.

623
00:44:55,997 --> 00:44:58,826
He really seems
to like you, <i>guero.</i>

624
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,610
Always making noise
when you'’re around.

625
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:02,090
Funny. Ha-ha.

626
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:05,354
Remember. The intake
valves are 200 feet down.

627
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:07,879
No, no. <i>Más.</i>
Seventy-five meters.

628
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:09,271
Do those comms work?

629
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:11,143
No. But we have cameras.

630
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,623
You can watch us with this.
We'’ll signal you when we stop.

631
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:12,813
All right.

632
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:14,772
A little bit. A
little bit. A little bit.

633
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,377
I hear you, tough guy.

634
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:08,842
What is that?

635
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:06,177
Come on!

636
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,666
Stay put. What happened?

637
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,841
Hey.

638
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,061
Chato!

639
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:24,064
Where'’s Junior?
- Where'’s Junior? - Are you okay?

640
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:27,198
- Where'’s Junior? Where is he?
- Where is Junior? What happened?

641
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,853
- Help him out! Help him out!
- Junior!

642
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,072
<i>Hermano.</i> Junior!

643
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:34,727
- Help him out! Help him out!
- Junior!

644
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:39,471
Help him out! Help him out!

645
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:47,218
Oh, my God! Junior!

646
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:55,878
Junior!

647
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,839
What?

648
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,060
What'’s wrong, Audrey?

649
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:05,366
No, nothing.

650
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,542
Just another one of
Mom and Dad'’s fights.

651
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:09,370
Oh, God.

652
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:14,419
Junior.

653
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,207
You will not take my
family away from me.

654
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,351
He didn'’t deserve
to die like that, Paul.

655
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,309
He-- He was--

656
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:39,661
He was trying to save us.

657
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:44,623
He-- He didn'’t deserve
to die like that. He--

658
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,152
He didn'’t deserve that.

659
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,677
Baby...

660
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:57,679
Honey, can I say?

661
00:51:57,853 --> 00:51:59,464
Everything is
gonna be all right.

662
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,163
You keep telling me that, Paul.

663
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:05,122
But it'’s not.
It'’s not all right.

664
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,601
It'’s not all right.

665
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:10,692
Hey, Paul. Hey, I'’m not--

666
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,913
I'’m not asking you to be completely
invested in what he'’s saying,

667
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,394
but you can'’t tell me
this is normal. Come on.

668
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,744
How does that help you?
How does that help you?

669
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:22,226
I don'’t know! But there'’s some
things that we can'’t explain.

670
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,403
I just need you to acknowledge
that, at least while we'’re here.

671
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:27,796
Here? You are not
supposed to be here!

672
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,192
I specifically told you to wait with
the kids and you blatantly ignored me!

673
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,068
You'’re right. You'’re right.

674
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,940
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

675
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,160
I'’m so sorry.

676
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:48,252
But I just couldn'’t stay there with
those drunks and Santa Muerte cult!

677
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:50,384
I couldn'’t! I couldn'’t!

678
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:53,518
And you told me it would
last just a couple of hours tops!

679
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:58,436
I... I thought it would be.

680
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,829
I did. I really
thought it would be.

681
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:02,527
I'’m sorry.

682
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,964
I'’m sorry.

683
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:07,532
I know, I know you'’re scared.

684
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,580
It'’s not just us.

685
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:15,061
The kids.

686
00:53:16,932 --> 00:53:19,674
Baby, if something
were to happen to them,

687
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,155
I don'’t know what I would do.

688
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:24,201
I am working on it.

689
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,160
I promise you, - I am working on it.
- Okay.

690
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:31,208
Are you guys done arguing yet?

691
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:33,819
Hey, hey.

692
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,082
No, no, no. We--
We weren'’t arguing.

693
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:38,650
What'’s this?

694
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:40,478
- Coffee.
- Coffee for me?

695
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:42,741
Oh, thank you.

696
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:44,743
I need to go check on Toro.

697
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,745
Oh, by the way, where'’s Junior?

698
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,581
He'’s in the electrical room.

699
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,278
He'’ll be back soon, Tommy.

700
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:00,062
Okay.

701
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:23,738
New shirt?

702
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,396
Junior gave me that shirt.

703
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:31,572
Shit.

704
00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:33,182
Can'’t wear it right now.

705
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:34,967
I'’m sorry, man.

706
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:38,057
I'’m sorry about your partner.

707
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,544
He gave me ten
years of his life.

708
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:51,505
Met him down south
in a rig when he was 20.

709
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:53,420
He never complained.

710
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,250
He always did what
I asked him to do.

711
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:02,429
Did you see it?

712
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:07,042
I did.

713
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:11,656
It'’s enough
firepower to flatten...

714
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,530
Why?

715
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,492
How much time do we have?

716
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:25,409
I don'’t know.

717
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:35,114
Hey, look. Hey! Hey!

718
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:37,595
Over here! Over here! - Get your gun!
- What'’s going on? No.

719
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,206
- No!
- Get your flare gun! Where is it?

720
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,555
There'’s nothing there!

721
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:43,601
- No! Give me that!
- What are you doing?

722
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,516
The ship is right
there! Don'’t you see it?

723
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,082
Right there, look! <i>Mira!</i>

724
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,258
- Look! Look!
- There'’s nothing out there!

725
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,744
How many times
do I have to tell you?

726
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:58,964
It makes you see things!

727
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,270
It plays games with your mind.

728
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,842
The only <i>cabrónes</i> we
can rely on right now...

729
00:56:15,023 --> 00:56:16,285
<i>El Demonio,</i> this spill.

730
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:20,246
This is Mother Nature
holding us accountable.

731
00:56:21,508 --> 00:56:22,727
This is our problem.

732
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:29,386
The spill?

733
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:33,041
The hell with the spill.

734
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,783
It'’s not my fault.
I'’m not God.

735
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:39,004
- No.
- I didn'’t create that thing out there.

736
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,398
You'’re not God.

737
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:44,052
More like a <i>pinche</i> puppet.

738
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:48,274
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

739
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:51,016
We'’re all puppets
in the end of the day.

740
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,932
The company'’s puppet, <i>pendejo!</i>

741
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:56,587
You think God cares
about this shiny watch?

742
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:58,371
Or your SUVs?

743
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:00,547
Or this pretty red shirt?

744
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:03,681
Hey, I paid my dues,
pal. I earned all this.

745
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:08,381
So you can just take your superstitious
Aztec bullshit and shove it up your ass,

746
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:11,079
because I'’m not about
to lose any of it, ever!

747
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:12,951
And this is burgundy!

748
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,432
You have no idea what you have!

749
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:17,564
Right?

750
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:20,175
- Okay, let'’s do it, man!
- Stop it! Stop it! What'’s going on here?

751
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,353
I'’ll tell you what'’s going on.

752
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:26,921
This.

753
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:29,315
All of this.

754
00:57:30,621 --> 00:57:31,970
It'’s just...

755
00:57:32,144 --> 00:57:33,406
It'’s just incompetence.

756
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,103
It'’s negligence.

757
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:37,279
It'’s mismanagement.

758
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:39,630
That'’s what it is.

759
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,327
And that thing
out there is just a--

760
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:44,112
a mutant freak from all of it!

761
00:57:58,562 --> 00:57:59,563
Tommy.

762
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:01,652
I'’m not hungry.

763
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:02,827
You need to eat.

764
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:07,745
- Hey, uh, food?
- Uh, what is that?

765
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:09,964
Uh, veggie lasagna. You want?

766
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:11,662
No. Give it to Toro.

767
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,751
Are we leaving now?

768
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:17,668
Yeah, but, uh-- but Dad'’s
got some work to do first.

769
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,234
Got it?

770
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,849
- Dad?
- Yeah?

771
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:26,590
What happened to your mouth?

772
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:28,548
- What?
- Your mouth.

773
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:31,072
Oh. I, uh, slipped on the deck.

774
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,207
Are we gonna die, Dad?

775
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:36,730
What, baby?

776
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:38,602
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

777
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:41,126
No. Hey, buddy.

778
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,042
What kind of a question is
that? No, no, no. Listen to me.

779
00:58:44,216 --> 00:58:46,000
Sometimes life just
gives us problems

780
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,263
that are bigger than
we think we can handle.

781
00:58:48,437 --> 00:58:51,571
We just need to focus and
take our time and figure it out.

782
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:53,878
Kind of like chess, you know.

783
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:57,316
With a king and his army.
- Right, Dad? - Exactly, <i>mi amor.</i>

784
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:00,145
And all of the pieces need to
work together in order to win.

785
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,627
Yeah, but sacrifices need to
be made to protect the king.

786
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,150
Hey, what?

787
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,848
In Tlaloc'’s case,
he preferred children,

788
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:11,548
and it was the tears of children
that created the rivers and waterways.

789
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:13,201
Waterways.

790
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,421
You think that'’s
gonna happen to you?

791
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:18,337
The Aztecs would
literally rip the fingernails

792
00:59:18,511 --> 00:59:21,470
out of their kids just
to get them crying

793
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,429
right before
slitting their throats.

794
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,387
Hey, hey. Buddy, buddy.

795
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,608
Listen to me. There'’ll be
no sacrificing today. Okay?

796
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,219
Yes, Dad.

797
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:36,007
And when you come
back, we can leave?

798
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:39,532
Exactly. That'’s what
I'’m trying to figure out.

799
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:41,447
Hey, hey, listen. You
guys want to help?

800
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,057
Yeah. What?

801
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,582
Okay. So, look around and
find anything that you can

802
00:59:45,756 --> 00:59:47,801
that might help
us get off this rig.

803
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:49,673
Like what?

804
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:52,240
I-I don'’t know. You'’re
smart. You'’ll figure it out.

805
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:53,328
Okay.

806
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:54,808
Waterways.

807
00:59:56,027 --> 00:59:57,028
Hey, bud.

808
00:59:57,202 --> 00:59:59,944
Wanna help your sister? Huh?

809
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:02,207
Oh, <i>mi amor.</i> Mmm.

810
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,470
I don'’t want you to
worry about a thing, okay?

811
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:06,515
I'’ll be right back.

812
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:20,573
Paul?

813
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:23,054
Paul.

814
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,925
Hey. Baby.

815
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:27,536
Hey, come on. You
can'’t do this by yourself.

816
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,842
Why the hell not?

817
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:31,323
If this is teamwork,
let him help you.

818
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,934
What, so he can slap
the shit out of me again?

819
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:36,763
Paul!

820
01:00:46,773 --> 01:00:48,732
You want to tell me
what you'’re doing?

821
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:50,429
I have a new plan.

822
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,300
We'’ve been over this.

823
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:54,781
I'’ve shown you every
blueprint I can find.

824
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,217
What are you looking for?

825
01:00:57,784 --> 01:00:58,872
- Waterways.
- What?

826
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:01,701
- Waterways.
- Waterways?

827
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,268
Yeah.

828
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:04,486
Okay, the generator.

829
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,623
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The drain.

830
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:12,103
Where'’s the drain?

831
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:13,757
The drain? Okay.

832
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:17,543
If I can reroute
the cooling system,

833
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:19,197
I can get the generator to work.

834
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:23,201
Okay, <i>guero.</i> Okay.

835
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:30,034
Maybe we can fix the radio.

836
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,169
It'’s stuck.

837
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:11,004
And now what?

838
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:14,965
Well, you weld, right?

839
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:37,596
<i>Mr. Chato.</i>

840
01:03:39,598 --> 01:03:40,686
<i>Me.</i>

841
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,470
Tommy, did you find anything?

842
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:43,689
Audrey.

843
01:03:46,387 --> 01:03:47,954
Mommy.

844
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:51,871
Daddy.

845
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,657
And Tlaloc.

846
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,355
Tommy, did you find any--

847
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:03,100
Tommy?

848
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,586
Lord of the sea,

849
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,460
grant us humble passage
through your turbulent sea.

850
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:17,331
Forgive us, Tlaloc.

851
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,964
Tommy? <i>Listo.</i>

852
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:43,705
I don'’t know if this works.

853
01:04:56,544 --> 01:04:58,459
- Tommy?
- Tommy?

854
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:00,331
Tommy!

855
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,681
Help, Audrey!

856
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:04,813
- Where is he?
- I don'’t know. I thought he was with you!

857
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,294
- No. Tommy? Tommy!
- Help, Mommy! Help!

858
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:11,429
Ines! Ines!

859
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:14,911
Mom! Mom, help!

860
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:29,926
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey!

861
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:32,754
- Hey, Mom!
- Audrey!

862
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,582
Hey!

863
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:39,587
Here it comes, <i>guero!</i>
Come on! Come on!

864
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:42,895
Go, Tommy! Go, go!

865
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:46,638
<i>Vamos! Vamos! Vamos! Vamos!</i>

866
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,363
How'’s my little pirate?

867
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,409
I'’ll take over. You go
ahead and get cleaned up.

868
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:21,107
Hey, hey, what'’s-- - what'’s wrong? What is it?
- Nothing.

869
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:22,979
Baby, I think I got
something figured out.

870
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:25,503
- I just need a little time.
- You ignored all the warnings, Paul.

871
01:06:25,677 --> 01:06:29,289
What? What warnings?
What'’re you talking about?

872
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:31,335
I saw your signatures.

873
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:32,640
My signatures?

874
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,208
You'’re gonna deny it now?

875
01:06:35,382 --> 01:06:37,994
Deny what? Honey, I don'’t
know what you'’re talking about.

876
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:40,039
You could'’ve prevented
this from happening.

877
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:42,433
Prevent what? Honey, I don'’t
know what you'’re talking about.

878
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:45,131
I saw your signatures
on the safety report.

879
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,440
You want to explain?

880
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,705
Huh?

881
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,533
- It'’s complicated.
- No, no, no. Don'’t give me that bullshit.

882
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,491
It is--Don'’t give me
that bullshit. Don'’t.

883
01:06:57,665 --> 01:06:59,363
What'’s going on, Mom?

884
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:02,583
Listen to me.
Ines, don'’t do this.

885
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,368
Not right now. Mom?

886
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:06,370
Listen to me. We can talk
about it when we get out of here.

887
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:08,328
- They should know.
- What? No.

888
01:07:08,502 --> 01:07:10,069
So they'’ll never do
something like this.

889
01:07:10,243 --> 01:07:12,550
- Ines, please, baby, please.
- Tell them. Tell them.

890
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:16,597
Tell them you'’ve been signing off
on this monstrosity for all these years.

891
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,295
- Dad?
- Haven'’t you?

892
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,774
Okay, I-I did it.

893
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:21,559
I did it. There. Is that
what you want to hear?

894
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,300
Please, let'’s just not - talk about this right now.
- Why?

895
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:25,519
Because we can talk - about it later.
- Why?

896
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:28,218
- Because it'’s my job.
- No, it'’s not your job!

897
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,394
It'’s not your job!
It'’s not your job!

898
01:07:30,568 --> 01:07:33,005
Your job is to shut
places like this down!

899
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:36,487
Do you have any idea
what you'’ve done? Huh?

900
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:37,836
To us? To...

901
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,360
Look around you, Paul.

902
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,884
People are dying
because of this.

903
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,930
- Dying.
- I had no choice.

904
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,714
I didn'’t.

905
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:49,021
I did it for us. - I did it for them.
- They lost everything.

906
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:51,241
I did it so that we
could have a better life.

907
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:54,070
- I had no choice!
- At the cost of other people'’s lives?

908
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:56,811
No, you did have a
choice! You did! You did!

909
01:07:56,985 --> 01:07:58,726
You...

910
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,033
You did it for yourself, Paul.

911
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,690
You are the monster.

912
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:07,909
Not that thing out there.

913
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:50,343
We'’re not gonna
make it, are we?

914
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,216
No, señor.

915
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:58,525
First time I inspected Diamante,

916
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,527
it was my first year on the job.

917
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,359
She was beautiful.

918
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:26,074
She was beautiful.

919
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:28,164
Because she was built

920
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:30,514
just outside of
federal jurisdiction,

921
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:34,605
and the administration just
rolled back all those regulations.

922
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,868
Companies like Nixon Oil...

923
01:09:39,044 --> 01:09:41,089
they were able to come
down to places like this

924
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:43,483
and implement their own
self-inspection procedures.

925
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,707
In that very first
test, she just...

926
01:09:51,448 --> 01:09:53,450
she failed miserably.

927
01:09:54,451 --> 01:09:56,540
I hoped that over
time, I'’d be able to

928
01:09:58,106 --> 01:09:59,804
help make improvements to her.

929
01:10:03,851 --> 01:10:08,334
<i>So, when I got back to shore,
I, uh-- I drafted my report.</i>

930
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:12,077
I included all
Diamante'’s hazards or...

931
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,732
or shortcomings.

932
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:16,951
And I turned it in.

933
01:10:18,562 --> 01:10:20,303
<i>The very next morning,</i>

934
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:23,131
<i>they called me into
this very fancy office.</i>

935
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:26,439
<i>They asked me if
I liked my new job,</i>

936
01:10:26,613 --> 01:10:30,138
<i>if my soon-to-be-wife and I
were settling into the new house.</i>

937
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:34,055
And they tossed-- tossed
the report back at me.

938
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:37,189
Right then and
there, they started

939
01:10:37,363 --> 01:10:38,669
"suggesting"

940
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:42,586
that I overlook some of
the problems with the rig.

941
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,284
<i>They insinuate...</i>

942
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:49,245
that if I don'’t do it,

943
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:52,683
they'’ll find somebody who will.

944
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,209
I revised my report.

945
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:01,996
I signed off on every
report that they gave me.

946
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:06,131
This went on and on for years.

947
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:12,050
All so some rich oil men up
north could keep raking it in

948
01:11:12,224 --> 01:11:14,574
while this little village
was laid to waste.

949
01:11:14,748 --> 01:11:16,228
I mean, I played my part,

950
01:11:16,402 --> 01:11:18,752
but I had no idea
it got this bad.

951
01:11:25,542 --> 01:11:27,718
You see that bomb?

952
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:30,416
Those charges are
the same ones we used

953
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,157
for underwater demolition.

954
01:11:38,772 --> 01:11:42,298
Bastards I worked for are
the same ones trying to kill me.

955
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:48,173
I knew who you were as
soon as I heard your name.

956
01:11:49,609 --> 01:11:51,350
Eh?

957
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,832
I just didn'’t know Nixon Oil
was trying to blow your ass up.

958
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,364
God.

959
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:09,325
Oh, it makes perfect sense.

960
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:14,155
They'’re my signatures
on the documents.

961
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,463
They get me out of the picture,
they have the perfect scapegoat.

962
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,162
<i>Ayayay, guero.</i>

963
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:26,559
What makes a measure
of a man is not his house,

964
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:27,734
dinero,

965
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:30,520
his clothes.

966
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:33,392
It'’s what he does in
times of uncertainty.

967
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:37,483
You'’re about to
lose your family.

968
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:40,094
And the only question
you gotta ask yourself is,

969
01:12:40,268 --> 01:12:42,009
how do you make it right?

970
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:44,664
The faster you
figure that out...

971
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:48,886
the faster you'’ll
know what to do.

972
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,156
And don'’t worry
about the <i>pinche bomba</i>

973
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,505
blowing our asses up.

974
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:28,882
Hmm.

975
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:31,058
You'’re making me nervous.

976
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:32,277
Sorry.

977
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:41,547
Hey, guys. What about this?

978
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,332
No, no, no, no, no. That
raft'’s <i>no bueno.</i> It has rips.

979
01:13:47,858 --> 01:13:49,337
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, Tommy.

980
01:13:49,512 --> 01:13:50,556
Help me open it.

981
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:53,516
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

982
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,953
<i>Somos El Diamante de Nixon Oil.</i>

983
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:02,960
Mayday...

984
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:12,883
Mayday, Mayd--

985
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,101
<i>Chingas.</i>

986
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:18,628
Okay, uh, Tommy, can you
take this to the back, please?

987
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,328
Hey, what are you guys up to?

988
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:26,766
Oh, Ma. Grab the acetone and
the life jackets from the lockers.

989
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:27,854
- Please.
- Acetone?

990
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:31,249
What are we doing?

991
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:33,643
We need patches. Lots of them.

992
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:36,428
- Do we have glue?
- Watch and learn.

993
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:39,126
I knew you'’d
come through, girl.

994
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,913
Here. Uh-huh. Did
you find everything?

995
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:43,626
Audrey, do you have another one?

996
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,802
- Uh, yeah. How many more?
- Give me one.

997
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:48,065
And I want two.

998
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:49,893
Guys, this is really working.

999
01:15:50,067 --> 01:15:51,068
Yeah.

1000
01:15:54,419 --> 01:15:56,508
Wait, how long
have you been here?

1001
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:58,684
And you'’re just now
trying to fix the radio?

1002
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:02,819
Truth is,

1003
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:07,171
you didn'’t want anyone
to come here, did you?

1004
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:10,957
You wanted Diamante to
go down the whole time.

1005
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:12,872
Even if it meant
going down with it.

1006
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:16,659
To save your people.

1007
01:16:18,486 --> 01:16:19,618
You got a plan, <i>guero?</i>

1008
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,229
Hell, yes, I have a plan.

1009
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:24,841
I'’m gonna blow that SOB up.

1010
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:28,279
You can'’t just blow up
that <i>pinche Demonio</i> rig up

1011
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:30,237
and expect
everything to be okay.

1012
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,805
Of course not. That'’s why
I'’m gonna seal the leak first.

1013
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:35,547
Stop the leak?
That'’s impossible.

1014
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:38,506
Clearly, you don'’t know
shit about repair valves.

1015
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,813
I saw something down there

1016
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:43,860
that only the guys with
expensive red shirts know.

1017
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:46,906
You mean burgundy.

1018
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,909
And, in the
process, if I'’m lucky,

1019
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,825
I will appease
an angry rain god.

1020
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,741
But how?

1021
01:16:55,915 --> 01:16:59,658
If I can just manually seal
the repair valve on the drill line.

1022
01:16:59,832 --> 01:17:01,138
It'’s a long shot,

1023
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:03,053
but hopefully it will
relieve enough pressure

1024
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:04,663
to trigger the
blowout preventer.

1025
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:06,186
Therefore...

1026
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,232
Sealing the well....sealing
the well. Exactly.

1027
01:17:08,406 --> 01:17:12,236
Seal the well, I grab the bomb
and I feed it to that son of a bitch.

1028
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,412
And then what?

1029
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:19,591
Then I-- I get to the bell.

1030
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:21,854
It should protect
me from the blast.

1031
01:17:22,855 --> 01:17:25,858
- What'’s left of it.
- And then you and I,

1032
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:29,253
we get us a really good bottle
of tequila and we get drunk.

1033
01:17:29,427 --> 01:17:30,733
You'’re buying.

1034
01:17:30,907 --> 01:17:32,256
No. No, you'’re
not--Chato, listen to me.

1035
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,258
There'’s no
other--Do not do this.

1036
01:17:34,432 --> 01:17:37,827
<i>Yo soy jefe.</i> - You will go down with it.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

1037
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,133
You'’ve got a big heart.

1038
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:43,049
But this rig, this-- this leak,

1039
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:44,790
it'’s my fault.

1040
01:17:44,964 --> 01:17:46,879
That thing down
there, it wants me.

1041
01:17:47,053 --> 01:17:49,839
You know that. You
of all people know that.

1042
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,841
And this will work.

1043
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:54,495
As soon as I go down, you
get my family into that raft...

1044
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,585
...and you get them off this
rig and you get them to safety.

1045
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,239
Take my bag with you. Okay?

1046
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:04,462
Hey, Dad.

1047
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:05,855
Yeah, buddy?

1048
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:07,421
Does this work?

1049
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:14,298
Wow. It-- It-- Is it done?

1050
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:15,386
Yep.

1051
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,692
You okay, Dad?

1052
01:18:16,866 --> 01:18:18,258
Yeah, baby, I'’m okay.

1053
01:18:21,305 --> 01:18:22,306
Hey.

1054
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:25,439
You guys ready
to get out of here?

1055
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,663
It feels like maybe
we should... pray?

1056
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:37,625
You know how to pray?

1057
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,671
Wow.

1058
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:42,718
After all these years of me trying
to make you believe in something.

1059
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:45,764
Okay. You finally
made your point.

1060
01:18:45,938 --> 01:18:48,332
You too, Mr. Chato.

1061
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:52,439
Paul. Wait, no.

1062
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:54,006
Listen.

1063
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,009
I have made terrible
mistakes and I am so sorry.

1064
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:01,709
There is a bomb on the rig.

1065
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:04,364
What?

1066
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:06,453
I-- I don'’t have time
to explain right now.

1067
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,238
I actually think it helps us.

1068
01:20:08,412 --> 01:20:10,240
I'’m gonna go down,
I'’m gonna dislodge '’em,

1069
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:13,460
and then I'’m gonna get up
inside the bell and drop '’em.

1070
01:20:13,634 --> 01:20:14,853
To kill the monster.

1071
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:18,422
That'’s not the
monster, remember?

1072
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,655
Baby, my mind is clear.

1073
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:42,272
I love you.

1074
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:49,018
Now, get the kids
to safety. Now. Go.

1075
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:59,593
We'’re out of tanks and
this one'’s almost empty.

1076
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:02,509
I'’ll make it work.

1077
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:06,731
I'’ve been thinkin'’, and if
you don'’t make it, what then?

1078
01:21:06,905 --> 01:21:08,472
Then look after my family.

1079
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:10,300
Okay.

1080
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,215
You'’re family too, man.

1081
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:16,349
Promise me, whatever
happens down there,

1082
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,092
you will get my
family off this rig.

1083
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:21,398
Deal?

1084
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:24,923
You got a deal, <i>cabrón.</i>

1085
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:27,491
If there really is some
pissed-off god out there,

1086
01:21:27,665 --> 01:21:29,667
maybe he'’ll cut
us some slack now.

1087
01:21:29,841 --> 01:21:32,017
Well, the <i>pinche Demonio</i> won'’t.

1088
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:37,893
I got no spit.

1089
01:21:44,769 --> 01:21:46,379
See you on the
other side, amigo.

1090
01:21:53,256 --> 01:21:55,432
I love you.

1091
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:01,612
Love you.

1092
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,233
All right.

1093
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,935
All good.

1094
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:22,763
See you around.

1095
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:49,312
Okay, <i>familia.</i> We gotta go.

1096
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:53,925
Tommy! Watch your step.

1097
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:56,667
Okay. Boy, I'’m
checking out for you.

1098
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:42,599
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i> Okay.

1099
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:43,730
I'’m ready. <i>Vamos.</i>

1100
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,080
I'’m ready.

1101
01:26:32,099 --> 01:26:35,190
Nes, are you there? Nes?

1102
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:36,974
Is that Paul?

1103
01:26:37,148 --> 01:26:38,193
Paul.

1104
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:41,283
Paul?

1105
01:26:41,457 --> 01:26:43,285
Honey, I'’m sorry.

1106
01:26:43,459 --> 01:26:46,679
We'’re gonna have to take a rain
check on those margaritas, okay?

1107
01:26:46,853 --> 01:26:48,638
No. What are you talking about?

1108
01:26:48,812 --> 01:26:50,988
Stick to the plan,
Paul. Stick to the plan.

1109
01:26:51,162 --> 01:26:53,251
<i>I'’m afraid this is the plan.</i>

1110
01:26:55,906 --> 01:26:57,429
<i>Honey,</i>

1111
01:26:57,603 --> 01:27:01,651
tell Chato, his town, his
people, that I'’m sorry.

1112
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:03,566
And things are
gonna get better soon.

1113
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:07,265
No. Get your ass up
here and tell him yourself.

1114
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:09,398
<i>Do you hear me,</i> cabrón?

1115
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:12,183
<i>I left you a gift in my bag.</i>

1116
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:14,316
<i>Make sure it gets
to the right people.</i>

1117
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:16,666
<i>OÓrale, cabrón.</i>

1118
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:18,494
<i>Audrey?</i>

1119
01:27:20,844 --> 01:27:21,801
Dad?

1120
01:27:21,975 --> 01:27:23,281
<i>Audrey...</i>

1121
01:27:25,022 --> 01:27:27,372
<i>my sweet, beautiful young woman.</i>

1122
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,291
That'’s your raft.

1123
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:36,729
You had it in you all
along. Remember that.

1124
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:38,035
I will.

1125
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:42,996
<i>Tommy.</i> Yeah, Dad?

1126
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,172
<i>Tommy, hey, buddy.</i>

1127
01:27:45,347 --> 01:27:47,174
<i>You'’re finally leaving.</i>

1128
01:27:47,349 --> 01:27:48,698
<i>It'’s just that...</i>

1129
01:27:48,872 --> 01:27:51,266
<i>I'’m not sailing
where you guys are.</i>

1130
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:57,141
<i>I left you a gift
in my bag, okay?</i>

1131
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:03,190
<i>The thing about pirates
is their-- their courage...</i>

1132
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:07,369
their bravery,

1133
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:10,720
their willingness to explore
the world with their crew.

1134
01:28:12,461 --> 01:28:16,073
<i>Buddy, you'’re the captain now.
You understand what I'’m saying?</i>

1135
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:19,163
I think so.

1136
01:28:22,514 --> 01:28:24,429
- Honey?
- Yeah?

1137
01:28:28,085 --> 01:28:29,739
<i>I should'’ve booked.</i>

1138
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:32,176
Don'’t-- Don'’t pull--
<i>I should'’ve booked.</i>

1139
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,830
Please, don'’t do--

1140
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,706
I'’ll check in on you
from time to time.

1141
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:44,754
I love you.

1142
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:50,934
<i>I love you guys.</i>

1143
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:01,858
Hey. Hey.

1144
01:29:02,032 --> 01:29:05,035
I love you too.
Okay? I love you too.

1145
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:38,851
Dad!

1146
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,179
He did it.

1147
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:14,234
Mom, Mom. Look.

1148
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:18,369
- Look.
- Hey!

1149
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:19,936
Hey, here!

1150
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:39,434
<i>Vamos.</i>

1151
01:31:00,237 --> 01:31:02,369
<i>Gracias. Muchas gracias.</i>

1152
01:31:33,575 --> 01:31:34,576
Hey.

1153
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:40,843
Daddy'’s always
gonna be with us, okay?

1154
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:44,411
Here.

1155
01:32:21,405 --> 01:32:23,189
Mom, it'’s raining.
