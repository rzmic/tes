1
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,947
Mom, dad, please
don't say things like sex.

2
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,908
It makes me wanna throw up.

3
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,826
Well, you need
to stay off the social media

4
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,912
because it's all over there
these days.

5
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:03,832
- Exactly.
- Yeah, but not from my parents.

6
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,667
Oh, you should be glad
we're talking about

7
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,670
things like this,
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

8
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,255
-Exactly.
-Hmm.

9
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,966
Well, I'm 17, and I'm in here,

10
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,427
so I don't wanna hear
about it anymore.

11
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,679
You about to get a baby brother
in a minute.

12
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,933
Oh, I'm with Angie on that.

13
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,727
I don't wanna hear that either.

14
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,230
- Oh, stop.
- Anyway,

15
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,065
I still don't understand
why you guys

16
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,359
didn't let me stay with Heather
while you're gone.

17
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,528
No offense, Auntie Kris.

18
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,072
Hey, you better be glad you're
not staying into Grandma's.

19
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,573
No offense taken,
but I was actually

20
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,534
wondering the same thing.

21
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,745
It's not like I didn't have
any special plans with Martin,

22
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,498
and no, they do not include
my baby niece.

23
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,166
-Hmm.
-Oh, gosh.

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,544
Now you're getting nasty,
too, Auntie.

25
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,462
What is going on
in the world today?

26
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,588
You would know
with how much

27
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,257
-you're always on that phone.
-Uh-hmm.

28
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,591
- That one.
- Anyway you guys,

29
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,801
we're gonna let you go.

30
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,427
Enjoy your vacation

31
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,304
and don't worry. Mwah.

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,848
You know baby girl
is safe with me.

33
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,307
We're actually gonna have
a movie night.

34
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,643
Okay.
Well, you guys have fun,

35
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,228
and I'm gonna go ahead
and call your grandma,

36
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,355
so we could check
on your baby sister.

37
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,441
Okay, mom and dad.
Love you guys.

38
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,193
-Bye, guys.
-Bye. Bye.

39
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,653
-I love you, baby.
-Bye.

40
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,490
You know
I was just playing, right?

41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,451
I love spending time with you.

42
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,248
Martin is always gonna be there,

43
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,084
but you, you're gonna go off
to college

44
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,711
-in a few months.
-Uh-hmm.

45
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,296
And you're gonna forget
all about me.

46
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,174
Oh, gosh,
stop being so dramatic.

47
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,842
I'm gonna visit every weekend.

48
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,719
That's what you say now
until you get there.

49
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,433
Auntie Kris, can I talk to you
about something?

50
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,895
You can talk to me
about anything, baby girl.

51
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,314
It's about college.

52
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,648
I don't wanna go.

53
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,027
Angie,

54
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,405
your parents have worked so hard
for you to go.

55
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,574
Yeah, I know,
and I appreciate them,

56
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,327
but it's not something I want.

57
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,330
You're 17 years old.

58
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,707
You really have no choice.

59
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,043
Yeah, I'm always being told
that I'm too young

60
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,420
to make any decisions
for myself.

61
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,589
That's not what I mean, Angie.

62
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,966
What I mean is,
you're gonna be 18

63
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,760
in a couple of months,

64
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,055
don't make any drastic decisions
right now.

65
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,307
Go with the flow
of your parents.

66
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,310
They love you and they only want
what's best for you.

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,729
But they don't care
about what I want.

68
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,650
Angie, what is it that you want?

69
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,111
I wanna model.

70
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,744
Angie, do you know
how many opportunities

71
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,540
there are in this world
for a beautiful woman like you

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,583
who actually has a brain?

73
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,919
But modeling is what I want.

74
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,257
-Look.
-What is this?

75
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:01,051
It's an audition
for models tomorrow.

76
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,636
If I win,

77
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,181
I can get a $50,000 contract
with Pacsun.

78
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,601
-And what is Pacsun?
-It's a popular clothing brand.

79
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,229
Look, I didn't tell my mom
or dad yet,

80
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,608
but I was wondering
if I could go tomorrow?

81
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,945
Angie, are you crazy?

82
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,239
Your parents will kill me

83
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,283
if I let you go
to something like that,

84
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,618
and while they're on vacation?

85
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,412
You know I have to say no.

86
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,665
You just don't get it.

87
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,251
Oh, come on, Angie.
That's not fair.

88
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,838
You're gonna thank me later,
anyway!

89
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,482
-Morning.
-Morning.

90
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,778
I'm sorry about last night.

91
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,780
I know I was a little extra.

92
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,452
I remember what it was like
when I was your age,

93
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,914
and I too thought
I had it all figured out.

94
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,291
I was head cheerleader
on my high school

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,793
and I wanted
to be a professional dancer.

96
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,629
So, what happened?

97
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,422
Turns out,

98
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,091
just as great as I am
at dancing,

99
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,677
I'm even better
at catching bad guys.

100
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,056
Look, the point is,

101
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,018
sometimes the things
we think we want,

102
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,603
they change.

103
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,273
You're so young, baby girl,

104
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,859
and you have so much time
to decide.

105
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,738
Yeah, you're right.

106
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,031
Thanks, Auntie Kris.

107
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,742
No problem.

108
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,373
The verdict for the Gregory case
came in this morning.

109
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,208
I guess we'll see
if your auntie is as great

110
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,876
as everybody thinks she is.

111
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,671
Oh, come on, Auntie Kris,
you're the best.

112
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,673
It's gonna be a guilty verdict.

113
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,174
No one's better than you.

114
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,510
We'll see.

115
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,930
How about I get you
your favorite sushi

116
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,058
from your favorite restaurant
on my way home,

117
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,726
and we actually have
that movie night

118
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,478
that you owe me from last night.

119
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,063
Sounds like a deal.

120
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,274
Hmm, come here. I love you.

121
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,942
I love you, too, Auntie.

122
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,361
I love you so much, baby girl.

123
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,280
I'll see you later.
And don't forget,

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,282
-we have date night, okay?
-All right.

125
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,576
- See you later.
- Bye.

126
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,376
The facts and the evidence,

127
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,003
it's all there.

128
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,339
For almost a decade,
Officer Swanson,

129
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,177
seized schedule one
and two narcotic substances,

130
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,638
seemingly to get them off
of the streets.

131
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,934
Only to entail sell said
the same narcotics back

132
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,478
into the communities
he patrolled,

133
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,481
all for his own personal gain.

134
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,615
Ladies and gentlemen,

135
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:13,118
we deserve better
and we demand better.

136
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,162
But the only way we can do that,

137
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,498
is by showing those
like Officer Swanson,

138
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,876
that their crimes
will not go unpunished.

139
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,170
Plain and simple,

140
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,381
we need to make an example.

141
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,387
Now, look at me.

142
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,807
And you,

143
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,477
you can do that here today,

144
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,854
by finding
the defendant guilty...

145
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,318
and bringing back justice

146
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,738
and respect to our system.

147
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,574
Thank you, Your Honor.

148
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,409
The prosecution rests.

149
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,869
Thank you, Counselor.

150
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,621
Ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

151
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,374
the facts and evidence
have now been presented.

152
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,709
The court room
will now take a recess

153
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,002
for the jury to deliberate.

154
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,761
There she is.

155
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,388
Kristen Jordan.

156
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,851
Congratulations.
That was a hell of a win.

157
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,645
Thank you, Cooper.
And indeed, was a team effort.

158
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,897
Oh, I'm still shock
that you even took the case.

159
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,941
Going up against a cop?

160
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,194
You could've tarnished
your 97% conviction record.

161
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,071
It 98, sir.

162
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,365
And I knew
losing wasn't a possibility.

163
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,033
I mean, after all,
Jurors 5 and 8,

164
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,869
both have relatives
that were political activists.

165
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,871
That's why we love you.

166
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,747
All right.
Drinks are on me tonight, okay?

167
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,000
-I'm gonna hold you to that.
-Everybody back to work.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,459
That was amazing. Great job.

169
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,128
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about the Johnson case.

170
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,046
-Of course, yes.
-What do you think if we use

171
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,507
the forensics that we have
on him and bring him back in?

172
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,717
I think we can definitely

173
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,801
convict him off
with just that alone.

174
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,398
Hmm.

175
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,401
Big win.

176
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,737
Congrats.

177
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,037
Hey, Auntie.

178
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,789
Another win. You were right.

179
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,249
I told you.

180
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,876
What are you up to?

181
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,672
Please don't be mad,
but I came to the audition.

182
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,885
What? After I specifically
told you not to?

183
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,512
Are you insane?

184
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,347
Where are you?
I'm coming to get you right now.

185
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:41,391
-Please don't be so dramatic.
-Angela?

186
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,268
Hey!

187
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,811
What the hell are you doing?!

188
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,688
What's going on?

189
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,524
Angie, what's going on?

190
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,526
Help, Auntie!

191
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,195
- Help!
- Angie.

192
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,448
- No! Help!
- Bri! Bri!

193
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,053
My sister trusted me.

194
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,183
She trusted me with her baby,

195
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,980
and I let her die.

196
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,982
This is--this is all my fault.

197
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,735
Kristen, I can't imagine
how hard this is for you

198
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,821
but this is definitely
not your fault.

199
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,908
Did you at least
find her body yet?

200
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,493
You don't have to do this now.

201
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,414
Stan, I have to.

202
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,543
Okay.

203
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,628
We triangulated her calls

204
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,839
to a little shady
photography studio.

205
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:56,633
Your niece's car was
in the parking lot,

206
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,177
but that's it.

207
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,803
There was no sign of her.

208
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,972
Studio?

209
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,557
It was clean.

210
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,768
It's owned by an Asian man
named Hong Wu.

211
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,770
He was out of town
and we don't have a way

212
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,356
to utilize who had the space
at that time.

213
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,987
What about her phone? Maybe--

214
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,072
Her last call
was a signal to you.

215
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,200
We're doing everything we can,
Kristen.

216
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,080
Kris,

217
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,834
I've known you
since you were a rookie.

218
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,544
You're like a daughter to me.

219
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,965
I've never seen you like this.

220
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,511
Go home, take some time.

221
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,890
I'm sure the DA's Office
will understand.

222
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,017
What do I tell my sister?

223
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,977
She's gone, Stan.

224
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,774
How?

225
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:08,539
Hey, Kris. Where's Angela?

226
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,792
What's wrong?

227
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,086
Where's Angie?

228
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,881
-Kris, what's wrong?
-I'm sorry.

229
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,883
What are you talking about?
Where's Angela?

230
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,469
Where's Angie, Kris?

231
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,179
Les, I'm so sorry.

232
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,140
-What's happened?
-She's gone. She's...

233
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,725
No, what?

234
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,477
Gio!

235
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,437
-She's gone forever.
-What?

236
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,856
-I'm sorry.
-No, what?

237
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,566
-I'm sorry.
-What?

238
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:37,484
-No! No! No!
-What's wrong?

239
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,111
-Where's Angie?
-Mom!

240
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,654
- No!
- Where's Angie?

241
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,114
-She's gone, Gio. I'm sorry.
-What do you mean she's gone?

242
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,740
-Where's Angie?
-I'm sorry.

243
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,993
I'm so sorry.

244
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:49,246
No!

245
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:05,012
They found her body
dumped in a trash bin,

246
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,763
in the woods near Jansen Park.

247
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,392
That's awful.

248
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,438
You know I could get
in trouble for this, right?

249
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,815
Stan, it's me.

250
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,360
I need this.

251
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,196
I need to catch this monster.

252
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,914
They found a tiny hair
but enough for DNA.

253
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,541
Well, that's good news.
Anything else?

254
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,293
There's no blood at the scene.

255
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:42,299
So does that mean
she was killed somewhere else,

256
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,176
and then dumped into the woods?

257
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,513
She wasn't just dumped.
She was placed, like posed.

258
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,097
Hey, Chief.

259
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,976
What the hell is this?

260
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,938
-Pump your brakes, Espinoza!
-No, Cap.

261
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,898
The last thing I need
is her snooping around

262
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,733
and jeopardizing
my investigation.

263
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,777
Look, I'm sorry for your loss,

264
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,696
but you know the rules,
Ms. Jordan,

265
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,740
or don't they not apply
to people like you?

266
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,493
I'm not jeopardizing a damn
thing, Espinoza. All I'm--

267
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,245
You're a hypocrite,
you know that?

268
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,705
You stay the hell away
from this case,

269
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,374
or I'll do everything
in my power to make sure

270
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,750
you're disbarred.

271
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,757
Sorry about that.

272
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,260
You know, he was partnered
with Swanson years back.

273
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,511
You would have put away
the person

274
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,887
that he was partners with.

275
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,474
And this is who you assign
to my niece's case?

276
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,059
Don't worry.
He's a boy scout

277
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,936
and one of the best
detectives we got.

278
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,813
Not only is he gonna do his job,

279
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,690
he's gonna do it by the book.

280
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:56,039
Okay.

281
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,464
-Hey, Kris.
-Hey.

282
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,968
I didn't wanna wake her.

283
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,012
Is she still asleep?

284
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,722
Yeah, she's finally sleeping

285
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,183
but she still ain't eating,
though.

286
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,899
Baby, give me one second, okay?
I'll be right back.

287
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,276
Kris.

288
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:26,111
By the way,

289
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,864
thank you
for letting us stay here.

290
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,866
It's doing a lot for Leslie.

291
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,329
We're gonna get
through this together.

292
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,691
Leslie.

293
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,237
Leslie.

294
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,323
No. No.

295
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,742
Leslie, no. No.

296
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,869
Wake up. Gio!

297
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,955
Leslie, no.

298
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,874
-Gio!
-What happened?

299
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,001
-She took some pills.
-Baby, wake up.

300
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,315
How is she?

301
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,192
She's doing as best as she can.

302
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,694
She's gonna be okay, though.

303
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,030
I gotta get this one home
and get some sleep.

304
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,907
Okay. I'll be here.

305
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,701
-Okay.
-Bye, Aunt Kris.

306
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,286
Bye, baby.

307
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,329
-Get some sleep, okay
-Uh-hmm.

308
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,206
-Both of you.
-Okay.

309
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,351
I'm sorry, Kris.

310
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,769
I'm so sorry.

311
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,272
I screwed up.

312
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,859
It just hurts so bad, you know?

313
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,738
I miss my baby.

314
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,949
I know, sis.

315
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,951
You don't have
to explain yourself.

316
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,039
You just have to promise me
you'll never do this again.

317
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,374
What about us, huh?

318
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,293
What about Diana?

319
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,129
She's already lost her sister.

320
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,256
She cannot lose her mother, too.

321
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,258
I know.

322
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,468
You're right.

323
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,555
I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,898
I have to take this.

325
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,484
Hello?

326
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:16,907
Are you sure?

327
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,373
Okay.

328
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,751
Thank you.

329
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,300
Sis, they got him.

330
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,554
That was the Chief of Police.

331
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,305
They made an arrest tonight.

332
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,765
-What?
-They got him.

333
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,061
There was a hit on the DNA
linked to the crime scene.

334
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,939
-They got him.
-So does this mean?

335
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,401
This means that they got him
and he's gonna pay, Les.

336
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,611
He's gonna pay, Leslie.
I promise you.

337
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,238
He's gonna pay.

338
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,423
Stay right here, baby.
We'll be right back.

339
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,051
I love you.

340
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,515
-I love you, baby.
-I love you too.

341
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,771
All rise.

342
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,481
Court is now in session.

343
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:34,151
The honorable
Judge Jacqueline Rice presiding.

344
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,612
Please be seated.

345
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,159
Your Honor,
the defense requests

346
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,870
that the charges
against my client

347
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,623
-immediately be dismissed.
-Your Honor, this is absurd.

348
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:49,708
Counsel is attempting
to turn this into a circus.

349
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,252
My office has obtained
critical information

350
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,880
concerning the evidence
in this case.

351
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,340
May we approach the bench?

352
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,841
You may.

353
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,303
What's going on, Kris?

354
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,846
I don't know.

355
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,389
I think they're trying to say

356
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,766
there's something wrong
with the DNA.

357
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,160
Well, apparently,
the DNA obtained

358
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,538
in this case
has been contaminated.

359
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,249
And it is no longer
a viable source of evidence.

360
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,375
-What?!
-What?

361
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,376
-Are you serious?
-No.

362
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,836
- What is going on?
- Order in the court!

363
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,259
Is there any new evidence
the state is prepared

364
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,845
to present at this time,
to meet its burden of proof?

365
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,347
No, Your Honor.

366
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,600
Well then, I'm afraid
the court has no other option

367
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,686
but to grant
the defense's motion

368
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:53,021
to throw out this case.

369
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,274
Mr. Wilkins, you're free to go.

370
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:56,775
Case dismissed.

371
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,443
-What?!
-Serious?

372
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,362
Kris, is that it?
He's free to go?

373
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,406
No, hell no.
What is this crap?!

374
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,241
- Please, please, please.
- No, no, no, no.

375
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:08,370
My baby, no, no. No, no.

376
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,457
You said we had him,
and now he's free to go?

377
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,376
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

378
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,463
-Why?
-Thank you.

379
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,549
No, no.

380
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,593
No!

381
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,470
-Hey, Auntie.
-I know you did it.

382
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,431
-Help me, Auntie.
-I know you did it!

383
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,266
And I swear
you won't get away with it.

384
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:30,767
I swear!

385
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,813
I swear you won't get away
with this.

386
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:37,065
-Calm down.
-Get off of me!

387
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,901
-Baby...
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

388
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,195
-It's okay. It's okay.
-He did it.

389
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,756
-Is this everything?
-Yup, just like you asked.

390
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,007
Thanks, Bri.

391
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,265
Oh, excuse me for a second.

392
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:54,518
Kristen, I heard
you were in the building.

393
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,019
Why don't you come in
to my office

394
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,521
so we can talk
for a couple minutes?

395
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,565
There's nothing
to talk about, Coop.

396
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,276
I've already told you,
I'm not ready to come back,

397
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:05,195
and honestly, I don't know when
or even if I ever will be.

398
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,575
The Wilkins files?

399
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,036
Whether you decide
to stay with us or not,

400
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,747
I told you
to keep away from this.

401
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,374
I did.

402
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,252
And look how well
that turned out.

403
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:23,630
Counselor, just remember
there's a thin line

404
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,716
between justice and vengeance.

405
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,892
Ryan.

406
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,022
You have some
friends in pretty high places,

407
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,482
Ms. Jordan,
to get these files open.

408
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,901
Thanks.

409
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,611
One more thing.

410
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,613
I need an address on Vernon.

411
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,156
You know I can't do that.

412
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,657
I could lose my license.

413
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,284
Mrs. Green,

414
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,411
I'm the assistant
district attorney.

415
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,415
I can assure you no one
will ever know I was even here.

416
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,931
Detective Espinoza?
What are you doing here?

417
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,308
I wanna know what happened
to the Morales case.

418
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,893
-What?
-You heard me.

419
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,064
I, um...uh, I thought
that maybe you could--

420
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,273
You thought what?

421
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,444
It was an accident.
The DNA sampling.

422
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,238
Don't give me that crap.

423
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,240
I know
how serious you take your work.

424
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,824
Now what happened?

425
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,920
Got your message.
You wanna see me?

426
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,050
I wanna know why your name
was on the sign-in roster

427
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,593
at the forensics lab.

428
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:54,346
-Dude, chill.
-Don't tell me to chill.

429
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,683
-I wanna know what you did.
-Come on, bro.

430
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,727
We had to get back at her,
for taking down Swanson.

431
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:05,983
So, you let a killer go free,
just to settle a score?

432
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,693
What kind of cop are you?

433
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,611
Whose side are you on?

434
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:13,115
Hey, leave the kid alone,
Espinoza.

435
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,992
He was only doing
what he felt was right.

436
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,910
Mind your freaking
business, Logan.

437
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,582
I'm not
gonna say it again, Espinoza.

438
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,042
Back off
or I'll make you back off.

439
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,009
Oh.

440
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,595
So all of you are in on this?

441
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:40,559
We let a murderer go free,
just to get back at ADA?

442
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,645
Hey, I ain't losing
any sleep over it.

443
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:47,149
Besides, I mean, how do we know
he's guilty anyway, huh?

444
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,572
You all deserve to be locked up.

445
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,784
What are you gonna do,
boy scout, hmm?

446
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,286
Snitch on all of us?

447
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,124
Let's go, guys.

448
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,001
Hey.

449
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,549
How you holding up?

450
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,009
You know me, hanging in there.

451
00:27:57,386 --> 00:27:59,429
Not a day goes by
that I don't miss her.

452
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,227
I'd feel better knowing
that Vernon was behind bars.

453
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,895
I know, sis.

454
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,647
Be patient.

455
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,442
I've been following him.

456
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,403
He's such a creep.

457
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,446
What do you mean following him?

458
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,574
Kris, isn't that dangerous?

459
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:21,910
This man is a murderer.
What if you get caught?

460
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,495
I'm not going to.

461
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,247
Trust me.

462
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,456
I know what I'm doing.

463
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,548
I promise you,

464
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:38,427
I'm not gonna stop
until he's behind bars.

465
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:40,762
I promise.

466
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,228
I heard the owner
is about to open this back up.

467
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:42,402
Yeah, back to business as usual.

468
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,238
What're you doing here?

469
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,907
-I could ask you the same thing.
-You know why I'm here.

470
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,910
Well then, I guess like you,

471
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,620
I'm a little stuck
on this one, too.

472
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,372
I'm not stuck.

473
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,290
I'm right where I need to be.

474
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,084
-If you're--
-Look, detective--

475
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,753
Pablo. The name's Pablo.

476
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,797
Pablo.

477
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,841
If you're here to tell me
that I need to leave,

478
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:05,133
-just no, it's just not--
-No.

479
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:09,137
I was gonna say, if you're
wondering where it happened,

480
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,640
we're thinking about two feet
to the left over there.

481
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,310
Luminal tests says that there's
a high concentration

482
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,229
of bleach and cleaning solution,

483
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:20,941
used to scrub the floor,
right in that specific area.

484
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,331
Did you have anything
to do with the evidence?

485
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,166
No, I didn't.

486
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,128
But there were few
other cops that did.

487
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,839
-They were trying to--
-Retaliation?

488
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,007
Yeah.

489
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,303
So if I had to guess,

490
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,389
this was my fault, he got away.

491
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,684
-Had I not--
-No, Ms. Jordan.

492
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,519
Kristen.

493
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,729
Kristen.

494
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,859
What I was gonna say is, they...

495
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:06,486
We.

496
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,281
We failed you and your family.

497
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:14,077
And for that, I'm sorry.

498
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,749
I guess I feel a little
like it's actually my fault.

499
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,838
And I suppose the department

500
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:27,508
isn't gonna do
a damn thing about it, huh?

501
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,093
There was too many cops
involved.

502
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,929
Why am I not surprised?

503
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,310
Would you like to get some
coffee and talk about it more?

504
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,603
No, thank you.

505
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,702
Now look to the left.

506
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,790
Now look to the right.

507
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:02,960
And give me more lips.

508
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:07,047
Don't look at me.

509
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,966
What was that?

510
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:09,967
Got you.

511
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,222
Okay, everyone.
That was magnificent.

512
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,558
It is a wrap.

513
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:19,226
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

514
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,400
Lynette? Uh...

515
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,196
may I have a word with you?

516
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,452
I'm so glad
you invited me here tonight.

517
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,164
Thank you
for accepting my invitation.

518
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,083
Are you kidding?

519
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,711
When The Vernon Wilkens
asks you out, you don't say no.

520
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,254
Hmm.

521
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:50,966
So, how many pics
do you have here tonight?

522
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,885
Photographs.

523
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:56,430
I have six photographs,
four portraits,

524
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,766
two still life,
and one abstract.

525
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,894
How much are they going for?

526
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:05,522
Starting bid
starts at 50,000 each.

527
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,399
Oh my God.

528
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,818
What it's like to be
Vernon Wilkens for a day, huh?

529
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,156
Hmm.

530
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,995
But this one...

531
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,290
This is one is my favorite.

532
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,506
It's beautiful.

533
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,633
It was a task to get.

534
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,429
Can I ask you a question?

535
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,476
Of course.

536
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,852
Why me?

537
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,939
Out of all the girls
you could have brought

538
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,983
here tonight,
why'd you choose me?

539
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,072
It was in your eyes.

540
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,409
They spoke to me.

541
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,625
Come along.

542
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,879
I'd like to show you some pieces
during the Renaissance Era.

543
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:14,758
Some might call it contemporary,
but honestly,

544
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,426
I call it avant-garde.

545
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:21,515
It's a distinct measure
between, hmm,

546
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,560
art and trash,
I'd like to say.

547
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,187
Got you.

548
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,335
- Lynette James?
- What the hell?

549
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,296
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to frighten you.

550
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,215
My name is Kristen Jordan.

551
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,884
I'm an attorney
for the Los Angeles DA's office.

552
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,386
Okay.

553
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:23,887
This is Orange County,
what do you want?

554
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:26,306
I...

555
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:31,979
We have reason to believe
you might be in danger.

556
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,522
What kind of danger?

557
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:38,151
Well, you were
with Vernon Wilkens tonight

558
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:41,947
and we actually
have been having him

559
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,782
under surveillance
for quite some time now.

560
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,076
Is this about
what happened with Angie?

561
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,996
Angie Morales, yes.

562
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,455
You knew her?

563
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,457
I knew Angie from high school.

564
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,168
She always
talked about modeling.

565
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,377
We weren't really friends
because she was a grade

566
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,920
under me but she was cool.

567
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,382
But I don't believe
that Vernon had anything

568
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,301
to do with her murder.

569
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,552
What's it to you, anyway?

570
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,137
That was my niece.

571
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,349
Oh.

572
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,978
Well, um,
I'm sorry for your loss.

573
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:15,856
But that doesn't
really change the way I feel.

574
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,941
Vernon doesn't have
to kill or rape anyone.

575
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:20,527
There are hundreds
of women dying to be with him.

576
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,321
Do you know what one
whisper from him

577
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:24,323
can do for a model's career?

578
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:26,909
-Are you one of them?
-What?

579
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,912
One of the ones that would do
anything to get at him?

580
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,749
Listen,
this is a pay to play game,

581
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:36,793
and I'm here to do whatever
the hell I gotta do to win.

582
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,837
And I know Angie
felt the same way.

583
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,757
Angie was 17 years old,

584
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,342
a baby.

585
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,302
And you know what she felt?

586
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:50,015
Pain, despair, betrayal, and

587
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:54,353
a cold steel blade
between her ribs.

588
00:39:54,353 --> 00:40:00,234
Now, if you don't watch yourself
with Vernon Wilkens,

589
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,861
I'm sorry to say,

590
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,489
you're gonna be
feeling that too, unfortunately.

591
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,002
Lynette James is her name,

592
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,421
and I believe
she is his next victim.

593
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:25,551
We have to lock up
Vernon Wilkens, now.

594
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,846
We have to stop him
before he kills her.

595
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,098
Wilkens isn't even in town.

596
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,349
I don't think
he's gonna kill anyone,

597
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,059
so I need you to calm down.

598
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,769
I know what happened
to your niece was tough,

599
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,437
but you're obsessing
with this guy.

600
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,439
I need you to stop it.

601
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,441
And how do you know
he's not in town?

602
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,235
Because I assigned
a few of our people on him,

603
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,486
that's how.

604
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:48,073
We know that Vernon Wilkens
boarded a flight to Paris,

605
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:52,619
first-class,
at 6:30 AM this morning.

606
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,539
You really think I was just
gonna let this guy walk?

607
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,332
-I--
-We've been watching him

608
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,126
for some time now.

609
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,003
Wow.

610
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:03,547
Then you know he was just
with her last night,

611
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,507
at an art show.

612
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,467
The bastard had the audacity

613
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:10,220
to have a photo
of Angela's hand on display.

614
00:41:11,847 --> 00:41:13,348
It's up for auction, Coop.

615
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,560
I know, Kristen, and I'm sorry.

616
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,187
But we can't just have
this guy arrested

617
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:21,273
because he's,
uh, a smug, callous jerk.

618
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:25,819
But you can have him
detained on suspicion.

619
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,196
You know
what I found suspicious?

620
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,364
It's you, Kristen.

621
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:32,242
What the hell were you thinking,
tailing the guy?

622
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:33,827
What if he would have made you?

623
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:37,998
I was thinking that I wanted
to see him pay for his crimes!

624
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,459
That's enough.

625
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,669
You're out of line
and you know it.

626
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:45,839
Wow.
That's so rich coming from you.

627
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,218
Your people are the reason why

628
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:50,594
he got away in the first place.

629
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:55,307
Why haven't any of them
been locked up, huh?

630
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,808
Tell me that!

631
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:58,977
Kristen, please,
would you listen to me?

632
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,604
Please.

633
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,231
While Wilkens is gone,

634
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,900
will you just stop
and do some thinking?

635
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,569
And think about
what you're doing right now?

636
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:09,947
Honestly.
You were so focused on this man,

637
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,740
I think
it's driving you a little crazy.

638
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,951
-I don't need time, Coop!
-Look, I'm...

639
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,537
what I'm saying is,
maybe there's another

640
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:19,665
possibility that you're
blinding yourself to.

641
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:22,125
No, there's not!

642
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,670
He killed Angela.

643
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:28,841
And he's gonna kill Lynette

644
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,176
if you two don't do something
to stop it!

645
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:36,265
Kristen, you must keep away
from Vernon Wilkens.

646
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,477
And that's an order
you better heed,

647
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:44,022
if you ever think you wanna work
with the DA's office again.

648
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:09,173
Okay, Katie.

649
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,508
I've got your special,

650
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:13,343
jelly belly cupcake.

651
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,803
-Thanks, Les.
-You're welcome.

652
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:22,102
Thank you.

653
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,771
- Hey.
- How's it going?

654
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,690
It's good.
Kind of slow,

655
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,026
but I'm sure
things will pick up.

656
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:31,945
It's Thursday.
It's always slow on Thursdays.

657
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,614
You got my sugar donut?

658
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,907
You know I do.

659
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,995
Yes! My favorite.

660
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,705
I mean, you know,

661
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,248
this family business
is the only thing

662
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,876
that's keeping me going
right now.

663
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,128
I just wanna say thank you
for that.

664
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,506
There's nothing I wouldn't do
for you, sis.

665
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:54,009
- I love you.
- I love you more.

666
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:57,054
You know, I almost love these
donuts as much as I love you.

667
00:43:57,054 --> 00:43:58,639
- Mm.
- Almost.

668
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,704
Hey, B. What are you doing?

669
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,916
I was at the coffee shop,
waiting for you.

670
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,753
I totally forgot, I'm so sorry.

671
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:42,850
Kris, what is this?

672
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:43,892
What are you doing?

673
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,477
You know what it is.

674
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,359
You took these pictures?

675
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,861
You've been following this guy?

676
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,487
I'm conducting
my own investigation.

677
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,989
Since when does taking pictures
of this guy

678
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,992
mean you're conducting
an investigation?

679
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,703
Evidence of his movement.

680
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,913
I have to be able to catch him
in the act.

681
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:07,666
- In the act of what?
- I don't know, okay?

682
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:12,045
Look, Kris, this isn't your job.

683
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,505
If you want this guy tailed

684
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:14,882
then you get your boss
or the cops.

685
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,383
I already did that.

686
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:19,303
What if I find something
that they didn't?

687
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:21,305
Come on, Kris.
You are not Superwoman.

688
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:25,475
Look, this can only end
one of two ways,

689
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:27,811
either you are stalking
an innocent man,

690
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,147
and we both know how
that can end if you get caught,

691
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:33,442
or you are tailing a murderer.

692
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:35,319
Both ways are bad.

693
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,529
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

694
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,828
This is why you've been
blowing me off, huh?

695
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,123
Huh? Because you've been
over here obsessing

696
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:50,584
-over this guy?
-Yes! I'm obsessing!

697
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:54,379
He killed my baby niece

698
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,923
and she was in my care!

699
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,966
This is my fault!

700
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,468
Kris...

701
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:02,471
My sister...

702
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:05,682
trusted me with her baby's life

703
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,059
and now she's gone.

704
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,771
It's my fault.

705
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,564
So, I'm gonna do everything
in my power

706
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:15,734
to make sure that monster
is brought to justice!

707
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,281
Does Leslie know
what you're doing?

708
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:23,534
Does she know that
you're over here doing this?

709
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,996
Yes. But she doesn't know
everything.

710
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:32,000
She's dealing with enough
right now and honestly...

711
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,757
I am, too.

712
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,930
Look, baby...

713
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,308
this isn't your fault.

714
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,770
-Nobody's blaming you.
-I blame me!

715
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,647
I...

716
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,691
I blame me.

717
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:58,443
She wouldn't want this
for you, Kris.

718
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,238
No.

719
00:47:01,238 --> 00:47:03,866
But what she wants
is her baby back

720
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:05,701
and we can't do that!

721
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,954
So, I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

722
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:11,206
to make sure he pays
for everything he did!

723
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:14,918
Kris, baby,
this is consuming you.

724
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,837
You gotta talk to someone.

725
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,592
Martin, you either get behind me

726
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:23,135
and support me

727
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,928
or you can just...

728
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:28,473
Or I can just what, Kris?

729
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,648
Or you can just leave me alone
and get out of my life

730
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:39,359
because honestly, I can't deal
with this right now.

731
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,405
Wow.

732
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,700
So, it's like that, huh?

733
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,248
It's like that.

734
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:16,605
Goodbye, Kris.

735
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:28,427
I know
you're doing this for me,

736
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:29,761
and I thank you for that.

737
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,722
I really do, but--

738
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:34,224
We're gonna get him, Leslie.

739
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,101
We just need real, concrete,
evidence

740
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:37,853
to put Vernon away.

741
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,897
I can get that.

742
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:42,024
We did the best we could,

743
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:44,318
and they let that bastard walk,

744
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,111
scot-free.

745
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:48,238
I don't trust
the justice system.

746
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:51,658
I think it's time
we take matters

747
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,160
into our own hands.

748
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,745
What do you mean?

749
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,914
I mean taking the justice system

750
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,373
into our own hands.

751
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:00,125
Leslie, you know
I can't do that.

752
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,251
I will lose my job

753
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,170
or even worse, go to jail.

754
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,381
He took my baby from me
and now he's walking free!

755
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:08,967
I understand that, Leslie,
but there's rules.

756
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:10,886
Don't give me that rules crap.

757
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:12,971
Either you're gonna help me

758
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,182
or I'm gonna help myself.

759
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,975
Come on, Leslie.

760
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,297
I always knew you're the one.

761
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:47,149
Ms. Jordan?

762
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:49,985
-Yes.
-I'll be your Maitre D'

763
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:51,278
for the evening.

764
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,405
Please, right this way.

765
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:05,292
The gentleman
will be with you shortly.

766
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,503
Would you like a glass
of wine, champagne?

767
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:08,754
Moscato will be perfect.

768
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:10,297
-Thank you.
-Right away.

769
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:32,736
So basic.

770
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,697
I would have taken you
for a red wine, woman.

771
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:37,407
You son of a...

772
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,408
Come now.

773
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,828
No need to make a scene.

774
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:44,164
No need
to get the authorities involved.

775
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:47,835
Call them. Go ahead.

776
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,130
And ruin the night.

777
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:57,010
After you so graciously accepted
my offer.

778
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:02,975
You?

779
00:53:06,395 --> 00:53:08,313
I wouldn't leave
if I were you,

780
00:53:08,313 --> 00:53:10,232
especially if one
were truly guilty

781
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:12,818
of what you accuse me of.

782
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,905
If I were you,
I would be worried

783
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,867
about my cohort's well-being.

784
00:53:21,618 --> 00:53:23,579
Where is Martin?

785
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:27,332
Excellent question.

786
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,670
Such a perfect topic
of conversation over dinner,

787
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,005
wouldn't you say?

788
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:37,509
Let's make a deal.

789
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,429
You sit,

790
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:42,097
have dinner with me,

791
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:45,517
and after dinner
I will give you Martin's phone,

792
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,936
and tell you where he is.

793
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:50,189
-Is everything all right?
-Oh!

794
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,941
Splendid.

795
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:56,195
I'll have a glass of champagne,

796
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,571
the blue caviar,

797
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:00,407
and the filet mignon,

798
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,452
extremely rare seafood plate.

799
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,496
Absolutely, sir,
right away.

800
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,667
What is this?

801
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,378
It's my attempt
to let the past be the past.

802
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:16,840
Let bygones be bygones.

803
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,135
Let's start a new beginning.

804
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,348
Let me get this straight.

805
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,266
You kidnap my boyfriend.

806
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,726
You steal his phone.

807
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,436
You trick me into coming here,

808
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,355
coerce me into having dinner
with you

809
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:34,900
after you just singlehandedly
killed my niece?

810
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,153
You are one sick psycho.

811
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:39,488
Oh.

812
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:42,824
No need to be so crass, Kristen.

813
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,410
Pygmalion. Pygmalion. Pygmalion.

814
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:49,331
I was merely just trying
to have a moment with you.

815
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,835
One would call this romantic.

816
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,837
If you...

817
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:56,630
think for one second

818
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,215
that I feel anything for you

819
00:54:58,215 --> 00:54:59,758
other than sheer hatred
and contempt,

820
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:02,469
you are sadly mistaken.

821
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:06,139
Hmm, I could understand.

822
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:09,226
You know, after all of
the fiasco with the authorities,

823
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,562
and then the tragic death
of Angela, well,

824
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:15,232
you know, one could see
your point of view.

825
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:17,317
What you did.

826
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:18,777
What you did to An...

827
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,573
What you did to Angela,
you animal.

828
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,074
I swear

829
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:27,744
if you speak her name
one more time,

830
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:30,038
I don't care
if Martin is safe or not,

831
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:33,083
I will personally kill you
right where you sit.

832
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:39,548
I see, you're not
gonna make this easy.

833
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,224
You know, it was tragic,
what happened to...

834
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,063
Your niece's tragic death,

835
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,399
that was awful.

836
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,611
But the real question is,

837
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:04,865
would you have traded places
with her?

838
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,241
What...

839
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,910
What kind of sick question
is that?

840
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:10,704
Just a conversation.

841
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,790
So?

842
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,044
In a heartbeat.

843
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:22,299
Interesting.

844
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:27,054
Madam, sir,

845
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,639
fresh caviar.

846
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,891
- Merci!
- And your champagne.

847
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:32,434
Ah!

848
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:36,480
You should really try
the caviar.

849
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,983
It is simply fantastic.

850
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:43,195
Simply to die for
in the West Coast.

851
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,198
I've lost my appetite.

852
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,118
So...

853
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,539
did I get the perfume right?

854
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,624
Hmm.

855
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:59,795
Vendetta by Valentino,

856
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,047
correct?

857
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:07,135
Ah, so apropos
for a prosecuting attorney.

858
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:10,055
Such a unique scent.

859
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:13,058
And it has been discontinued
for a few years now,

860
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:15,269
so it wasn't easy to get.

861
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,729
How do you even know
what perfume I wear?

862
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:23,026
That day in the courtroom.

863
00:57:23,026 --> 00:57:25,654
Then, again, at the gallery.

864
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,616
-What?
-My mother used to wear it.

865
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:32,744
You don't really believe
that I didn't know

866
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:35,747
that you were following me
around, counselor.

867
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,749
But I must say,

868
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,669
oh, I was so thrilled

869
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,546
to have you...

870
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:44,464
so close.

871
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,885
Ah, but I was hoping
that you would go even further.

872
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,970
That you would follow me
to Paris

873
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,431
so you could see the chandeliers

874
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,683
and the Eiffel Tower.

875
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:57,769
So I could show you all
of the sites.

876
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:00,063
This is a game to you,
isn't this?

877
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,815
On the contrary,

878
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:04,526
Kristen,

879
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:07,070
this is kismet.

880
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,032
Our worlds were meant
to be intertwined,

881
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:11,700
fate...

882
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,744
brought you into my life.

883
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:16,496
It wasn't fate.

884
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:18,165
It was your crime.

885
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:19,958
You are a murderer,

886
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,044
and you were caught.

887
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:24,922
The only reason
why you sit here free

888
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,423
is because you got lucky.

889
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:30,427
What you call serendipitous,
I call divinity.

890
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:32,054
Call it what you want,

891
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,805
but I promise you
you will never do it again

892
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:35,015
because I'm personally going

893
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,309
to make sure
I take you down myself.

894
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:41,772
Why wallow in such sorrow?

895
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:43,649
Ah,

896
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:45,859
you know, my attorneys
have informed me

897
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:48,153
that they have arrested a man

898
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:51,698
that they believe is responsible
for the crime.

899
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,033
See?

900
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,701
Justice has been served.

901
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:58,247
So, please,

902
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,790
let's start anew.

903
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:04,503
Get this through
your thick psychotic skull.

904
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:06,088
I wasn't surveilling you

905
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:09,299
out of some twisted attraction.

906
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,053
You are nothing more to me
than a depraved lunatic

907
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:15,138
that deserves
to spend the rest of his life

908
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:18,058
in a six by eight concrete home
on death row.

909
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:20,727
Do you understand me, Vernon?

910
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,397
Did you catch my drift?

911
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,235
This is the part where we kiss.

912
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:31,697
But since you're gonna be
such a Debbie Downer...

913
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:33,949
Let's just call it a night.

914
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,451
Where is Martin, Vernon?

915
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,914
Here's Martin's phone.

916
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:44,835
He's in the LA Marriott,

917
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:46,503
Room 4266.

918
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:52,176
You should run along.

919
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:55,429
No telling how long
he will be conscious.

920
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,129
Pablo.

921
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:31,840
Kristen, what the hell
is going on?

922
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,342
I don't know. It's Vernon,

923
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,010
I think he did something
to Martin.

924
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:37,095
Oh, okay. All right.
Did he say a room number?

925
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,640
-What's the room number?
-4266.

926
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,099
4266.

927
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,521
I need a key
to 4266 right away.

928
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,274
Mr. Sanders,
if you're in there, open up.

929
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:50,275
It's the police.

930
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:53,695
Can I--can I help you?

931
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,280
Martin?

932
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,492
Oh, you must be
the ex-girlfriend.

933
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:00,702
Martin. Martin.

934
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,122
Martin, wake up!

935
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:07,292
- Kristen?
- Son of a bitch.

936
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:08,627
What are you doing here?

937
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,756
-You lost something?
-What's going on?

938
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,216
Kristen,
maybe we should go.

939
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:15,968
Did Vernon put you up to this?

940
01:01:15,968 --> 01:01:18,470
Hey, I'm not in this.

941
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,764
This is between you guys.

942
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,558
Yeah, Kris, it's between us.

943
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,351
You kick me out, remember?

944
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,894
You...

945
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,729
Come on. Come on.
Definitely time to go.

946
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:30,357
- Let's go.
- Don't call me!

947
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,484
- It's over, Martin.
- Come on.

948
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:44,621
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

949
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:47,165
Vernon, he text me.

950
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:48,959
He invited me to dinner.

951
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:52,045
You had dinner
with Vernon Wilkens?

952
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:53,338
Yes. No!

953
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:56,508
I went there thinking
it was Martin.

954
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,427
He got ahold of his phone.

955
01:01:58,427 --> 01:02:00,971
I'm guessing that slut upstairs
must've handed it over

956
01:02:00,971 --> 01:02:03,098
in between screw sessions.

957
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:04,850
It's when I got there

958
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,769
that he insinuated
something happened to Martin.

959
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,521
Why go through all the trouble?

960
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:11,315
He knows I'm tailing him.

961
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:14,151
In his sick mind,
it's some type of flirtation.

962
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:17,779
He referred to me attacking him
in court as kismet fate.

963
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,117
You gotta be kidding me.

964
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:25,537
-You sure know how to pick 'em.
-Come on, Pablo.

965
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,165
It's not funny.

966
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:30,584
I could be next
on this man's hit list.

967
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:33,003
Okay. All right. It's okay.

968
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:37,966
You got some place to stay?
Your sister's maybe?

969
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:40,844
I would never bring
this murderer to her doorstep.

970
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,679
It's been enough.

971
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:43,972
You're right.

972
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:48,435
All right. Go home, pack a bag,
get some clothes.

973
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,646
I got some place you can stay.

974
01:02:50,646 --> 01:02:52,439
I usually put my CIs there
during a trial

975
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:53,607
to keep tabs on them.

976
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:57,027
-Thank you.
-You got protection?

977
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,238
I got pepper spray
and a Taser in the car.

978
01:02:59,238 --> 01:03:00,656
Here.

979
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:01,990
Take this.

980
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,911
You know how to use it?

981
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:07,120
Do I?

982
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:09,456
Hey.

983
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:12,668
I'll send somebody to tail you,

984
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:14,127
make sure you get there safe.

985
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,797
Thanks so much, Pablo.

986
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,800
Yeah, anytime.

987
01:04:28,118 --> 01:04:30,787
Detective Espinoza.

988
01:04:30,787 --> 01:04:34,208
Uh, please, come in.

989
01:04:39,588 --> 01:04:42,674
What brings you here
so late at night?

990
01:04:44,259 --> 01:04:47,471
I don't know what kind of game
you're trying to play.

991
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:49,223
But it ends now.

992
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,391
You hear me?

993
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:53,602
I'm--I--I'm so sorry.

994
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,062
You...

995
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,271
You caught me.

996
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,565
I--I'm at a loss.

997
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:00,400
I have no idea

998
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,152
what you're talking about.

999
01:05:02,152 --> 01:05:05,030
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1000
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,031
Kristen!

1001
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:09,535
You think it was funny
trying to set her up like that?

1002
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,246
Ms. Jordan...

1003
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:18,585
I believe you and she
misunderstood my intentions.

1004
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:20,587
I was merely trying
to inform her

1005
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:23,841
of her significant
other wayward behavior.

1006
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:28,846
Being a good Samaritan
and giving her his phone.

1007
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:32,850
I know what you're trying to do.

1008
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,727
You're trying to intimidate her,

1009
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:37,688
let her know you can get at her.

1010
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,736
Oh, please, please.

1011
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,530
How does it feel now?

1012
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,032
No, no, no. Please, please,
don't hurt me, please.

1013
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:51,577
How does it feel to be
threatened right in your face?

1014
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:53,954
Please, don't hurt me.

1015
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:05,048
Uh, it's seems the LAPD

1016
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:08,635
is looking for another
discrimination lawsuit.

1017
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:13,974
Now, unless you're prepared

1018
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:18,437
to see how far this will go,

1019
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:22,316
but I would think twice
about your next move.

1020
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,405
Ah, good man.

1021
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,992
This isn't over, Wilkens.

1022
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:38,123
You are amusing.

1023
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:39,374
Huh.

1024
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:41,919
Such bravado

1025
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:44,755
playing the white knight,

1026
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:47,174
showing up to be the hero.

1027
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:51,637
Does she know?

1028
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:53,096
What are you talking about?

1029
01:06:53,096 --> 01:06:56,016
That you have feelings for her?

1030
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:05,108
Ah, another rooster
in the hen house.

1031
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,401
Ah.

1032
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:12,032
Like I said,
it is of no consequence to me.

1033
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:16,286
But you are amusing.

1034
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:20,707
Have a good night, detective.

1035
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,847
Questioned the girl.

1036
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:36,682
Name is Beauty.

1037
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:38,976
She said some guy paid her
to steal Martin's phone

1038
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,394
and drug him.

1039
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,437
10K.

1040
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:44,940
You know, whoever it is
got a lot of money

1041
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,067
to be able to drop $10,000
or something like that.

1042
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:48,986
You think
it was Vernon?

1043
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:50,320
Could be.

1044
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,698
She didn't give us his name.

1045
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,117
I found something
interesting in Vernon's file.

1046
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:57,369
Apparently,
Vernon has a history of violence

1047
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:59,037
dating back to his childhood.

1048
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,831
He watched his father
killed his mother

1049
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,040
right in front of him,

1050
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,668
who was an inspiring model.

1051
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,503
And you know what else
is interesting?

1052
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:08,130
It was a single stab wound

1053
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,132
on the left side
between the ribs.

1054
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,092
I'll do you one better.

1055
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:13,969
I called in a favor at the FBI

1056
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,388
and they did some digging
on your boy.

1057
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:19,641
It turns out that every single
address that Vernon's had

1058
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,477
in and out of the country
over the past 20 years,

1059
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,855
has had a woman's
mutilated corpse

1060
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:27,149
found within a 30-mile radius.

1061
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,776
-Are you serious?
-As a heart attack.

1062
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,778
Why haven't they done
anything before now?

1063
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,448
We need to get him.

1064
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,657
He wasn't on their radar.

1065
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,576
They haven't been able
to connect the dots.

1066
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,077
Think about it.

1067
01:08:39,077 --> 01:08:41,872
That's ten countries,
three continents.

1068
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:44,208
All the victims
have been homeless,

1069
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:46,835
transient, known prostitutes.

1070
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:48,587
That's over 20 victims.

1071
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:51,507
And every time
they would get closer,

1072
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,383
he'd just pick up and leave

1073
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,260
before they can even
blink their eyes.

1074
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,138
So, why did he stay
after Angela?

1075
01:08:58,138 --> 01:08:59,223
That's a good question.

1076
01:09:06,271 --> 01:09:07,856
Sorry, we're closed.

1077
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,162
I'm sure you have time

1078
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:23,997
for one more customer.

1079
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,215
-He came to the bakery?
-What the hell, Kris?

1080
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:35,467
What am I supposed to...
I wanna kill him.

1081
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:36,969
What do you mean,
he come to the shop?

1082
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,471
Calm down.
Let me figure this out.

1083
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:40,681
Just calm down.

1084
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:43,058
I know. Let me talk to her.

1085
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:46,562
Sis.

1086
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,233
I came as fast as I could.

1087
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:54,236
-What happened?
-He came to the shop.

1088
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:55,988
He threatened to kill me.

1089
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,532
He threatened the family.

1090
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:02,035
I'm so sorry.

1091
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:05,998
I swear,
we're gonna get this bastard.

1092
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,584
Really? Who?

1093
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:09,751
The police department?

1094
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:14,548
Excuse me
if I've lost all faith.

1095
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:18,302
Because of them, he's out free.

1096
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:20,929
Free to do
whatever the hell he wants,

1097
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,348
including what he did today.

1098
01:10:25,642 --> 01:10:27,811
Look, I'll talk to Pablo

1099
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,980
and see what we can do
about this.

1100
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,357
I'm tired of you
playing by the book.

1101
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,902
I get you not trying
to lose your job,

1102
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:37,446
but if you don't do
something about this,

1103
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:41,116
you're gonna end up
losing your family.

1104
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,534
He's insane!

1105
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:09,811
Okay. You know
I've been watching him.

1106
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:12,773
So, I know everything
there is to know about him.

1107
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:14,858
Where he lives,
where he hangs out.

1108
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:19,821
And like you said,

1109
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:22,032
the law isn't doing
enough for us.

1110
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,952
So, I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

1111
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:34,586
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

1112
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:37,005
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

1113
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:39,466
to make sure I bring down
this monster.

1114
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:43,679
Whatever it takes.

1115
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:46,557
Whatever it takes.

1116
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,389
Mr. Wilkens,
right this way.

1117
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:53,040
You are beautiful.

1118
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,208
Thank you.

1119
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,461
Mind if I take a seat?

1120
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:05,928
Ms. Jordan,
such a pleasant surprise.

1121
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:09,264
You know I'm not gonna take
too much of your time.

1122
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:12,643
I just wanted to personally
let you know

1123
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:16,563
I'm coming for you, Vernon.

1124
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:21,276
And what I'm gonna
do to you, hmm,

1125
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:23,111
is far more worse

1126
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,947
than what you actually deserve.

1127
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,784
Is that a threat?

1128
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,577
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,545
Not if I get to you first.

1130
01:13:46,593 --> 01:13:48,220
Enjoy.

1131
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,638
Oh, I will.

1132
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,222
-Let's see who's stalking.
-Oh, so sorry, Vernon.

1133
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:08,008
This is for Angela.

1134
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,321
Come on, Mommy.
I don't wanna be late!

1135
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,617
Ooh, look at you.

1136
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:35,202
Daddy did good with your outfit,

1137
01:15:35,202 --> 01:15:36,662
baby girl.

1138
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:37,955
You're ready for picture day,
huh?

1139
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:39,289
-Yeah.
-All right. Come on.

1140
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,666
Let mommy grab her keys.

1141
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,063
Hey, Pablo. What's going on?

1142
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,982
I'm here.

1143
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:05,983
Really?

1144
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:13,073
I'll be right down.

1145
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,962
And what brings you here?

1146
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:29,423
Well, I figured today
was a special day.

1147
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:31,508
It's your first day
back at work.

1148
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,260
I wanted to do
the honors of taking you.

1149
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,761
Aren't you a gentleman?

1150
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,144
So, does that mean
you get coffee too?

1151
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:43,520
We can arrange that.

1152
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:04,416
Here.

1153
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,516
What a beautiful dress.

1154
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:21,934
Oh, thank you.

1155
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:26,146
What's your name?

1156
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,065
Diana.

1157
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:32,069
Wow. Such a beautiful name.

1158
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:34,488
Big smile, Diana.

1159
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,325
Big smile.

1160
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:55,926
Kristen,
it's great to have you back.

1161
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,011
It feels good to be back, Coop.

1162
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:59,429
Thank you.

1163
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:07,563
-Diana!
-Diana!

1164
01:18:07,563 --> 01:18:09,356
Have a good day, guys.

1165
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,650
Diana!

1166
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,068
-Hey, Leslie.
-Hey, Roger.

1167
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,570
Have you seen Diana?

1168
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,530
She's not here.
She left with her uncle.

1169
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:21,034
Uncle? What?
What have you done?

1170
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:23,245
- Uh, I--
- No! No. Call the police!

1171
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:25,706
-Is everything okay?
-No! Call the police!

1172
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:26,790
Oh, my God!

1173
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:34,214
What is going on?

1174
01:18:34,214 --> 01:18:35,924
He got my baby, Kris.

1175
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:38,218
He got my baby.

1176
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:42,055
Do we know for sure
that it was Vernon Wilkens?

1177
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:43,974
We've obtained school
security footage of the man

1178
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:45,475
thought to be the assailant

1179
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,561
posing as a school photographer.

1180
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:50,564
We don't know how he got her,
but the footage is of him

1181
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:52,191
putting her in the trunk
of his car.

1182
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:55,652
-My baby. My baby.
-What? What's going on?

1183
01:18:55,652 --> 01:18:59,698
Please, Lord, don't let him
take both of my babies.

1184
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:06,121
Les, are you okay?

1185
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,123
-Relax.
-Babe. Babe, breathe, baby.

1186
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,875
- Relax.
- Baby, breathe

1187
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,919
-Ma'am, let us help her.
-Breathe.

1188
01:19:11,919 --> 01:19:14,296
She's okay.

1189
01:19:14,296 --> 01:19:17,090
She's just stressed.
Let's give her some space.

1190
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,550
Can somebody give me
a cold towel?

1191
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,760
I'll be right back.

1192
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,745
Hey, where's that cold towel?

1193
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,706
Kristen!

1194
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:50,916
Kris!

1195
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,418
Kristen!

1196
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:55,212
- Kristen!
- Kris!

1197
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,134
She's not in there.

1198
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:03,053
I need ice on Ms. Jordan now!

1199
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:05,347
Kristen!

1200
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:14,124
Come on, Vernon!

1201
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:15,792
I'm here!

1202
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:19,880
Where is Diana?

1203
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,673
Aunt Kris!

1204
01:21:21,673 --> 01:21:24,092
I'm here, baby!

1205
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:26,929
Aunt Kris! Aunt Kris!

1206
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,769
Aww, touching.

1207
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:37,231
Come on, Vernon!

1208
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,568
I'm the one you want, right?

1209
01:21:43,237 --> 01:21:44,988
Isn't that why you took her...

1210
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:47,699
to get to me?

1211
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:50,452
Well, I'm here now!

1212
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,498
Just me, no cops!

1213
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:57,835
Yes, that is correct.

1214
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,089
You are the one I want.

1215
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:05,843
Actually,
you're the only one I need.

1216
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:11,473
Why?

1217
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:17,271
What makes me so special?

1218
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:22,192
Don't you know
that you are my reason?

1219
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:26,738
Everything that I've done
has led me to you.

1220
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:35,873
Is that why
you killed Angela and Lynette?

1221
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:38,375
Ah.

1222
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,294
You're so sweet, Kristen.

1223
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:43,839
You remind me of her.

1224
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,886
Her who?

1225
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,348
The only woman
I ever loved.

1226
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:55,559
My mother.

1227
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:59,354
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1228
01:22:59,354 --> 01:23:01,857
But you didn't.
You didn't because you need me

1229
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:05,611
just as much as I need you.

1230
01:23:05,611 --> 01:23:07,070
Come on now, Vernon.

1231
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:09,323
Enough!

1232
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:14,244
You wanna kill me? Kill me!

1233
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,874
Just, please, let Diana go!

1234
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:23,670
It's in the eyes,
you know.

1235
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:27,382
That's how I choose them.

1236
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,846
That's how I knew you were
the one the moment I saw you.

1237
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:35,224
I didn't have to find you.

1238
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,519
No, you found me.

1239
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:44,107
Ah, so tragic what happened
to Angela, but, well...

1240
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:49,321
never could I imagine
that she would lead me to you.

1241
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:52,282
Come on, Vernon.

1242
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:56,328
I know all about you, Vernon.

1243
01:23:56,328 --> 01:23:58,914
How your mother

1244
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,667
was killed in front of you.

1245
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:04,753
So tragic...

1246
01:24:05,879 --> 01:24:07,756
for anyone,

1247
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:09,174
but yet...

1248
01:24:11,343 --> 01:24:12,803
not you, Vernon.

1249
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:15,931
You're a survivor.

1250
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:18,809
You're not a monster

1251
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:21,019
like the man who killed
your mother

1252
01:24:21,019 --> 01:24:22,855
right in front of you.

1253
01:24:27,651 --> 01:24:29,403
Even took photos...

1254
01:24:30,988 --> 01:24:32,948
with the only thing

1255
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,909
your father left you with.

1256
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:39,705
His camera.

1257
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,584
Is that what this is all about,
Vernon?

1258
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:45,169
Your mother?

1259
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:50,841
You don't know
anything about me!

1260
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:54,928
Why don't you just
leave it alone?

1261
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:58,390
But no, you had to keep digging
and you had to keep digging.

1262
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,018
You're obsessed with me.

1263
01:25:02,895 --> 01:25:04,897
You looked for me

1264
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:08,567
and you even took the time

1265
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,903
to get to know me.

1266
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:16,742
That's how I knew
that we belong together.

1267
01:25:16,742 --> 01:25:19,161
That's why I spared your life.

1268
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:24,249
I'm sorry, Vernon.

1269
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:29,087
No child should have to endure
that type of pain.

1270
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:34,510
But it still doesn't
give you the right

1271
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,846
to inflict that pain
onto others!

1272
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:42,643
You think
this is the Oedipus complex.

1273
01:25:42,643 --> 01:25:45,062
Don't you psychoanalyze me!

1274
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:47,314
You know what?

1275
01:25:49,733 --> 01:25:51,026
You're right.

1276
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:56,156
You took my baby niece
away from me!

1277
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:03,664
You are pitiful!

1278
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:07,125
You're nothing special!

1279
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,132
You're nothing but a small man

1280
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:16,927
that has mother issues!

1281
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,661
Oh, Diana!

1282
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:44,621
I'm so sorry, baby.

1283
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,790
Are you--are you okay?

1284
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,501
Oh, baby. I'm so sorry.

1285
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:50,752
We gotta get out of here.

1286
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:55,174
Watch out!

1287
01:26:55,174 --> 01:26:57,092
Auntie!

1288
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:04,266
You don't know me!

1289
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:06,727
You are nothing!

1290
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:11,356
My mother was a queen!

1291
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:13,734
And she was taken from me!

1292
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:17,696
Vernon, no.

1293
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:21,992
No, Vernon. I'm sorry.

1294
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:23,660
You were right, Vernon.

1295
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,746
Please.

1296
01:27:25,746 --> 01:27:28,040
You were right.

1297
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,791
I did.

1298
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:32,878
I took the time
to get to know you.

1299
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:35,088
I did. I'm sorry.

1300
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:37,758
You were right.

1301
01:27:37,758 --> 01:27:39,593
We belong together.

1302
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:43,680
Now, let me heal you, Vernon.

1303
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,224
Please.

1304
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:48,769
Please.

1305
01:27:51,605 --> 01:27:53,941
You can't help me.

1306
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:35,482
Auntie!

1307
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,029
Move, baby.

1308
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,210
We got him, baby.

1309
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,504
We got him. Let's go.

1310
01:28:57,504 --> 01:29:00,465
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1311
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:02,301
Go! Go!

1312
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:20,068
Oh, my God.
Oh. Oh, my God!

1313
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,404
Look who's here.

1314
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:23,655
-Baby!
-Mommy!

1315
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:26,450
Oh, my God, baby! Oh, baby.

1316
01:29:28,493 --> 01:29:30,495
I'm so happy you're okay, baby.

1317
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:34,499
Auntie Kris got the bad guy,
Mommy.

1318
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:35,918
He can't hurt us anymore.

1319
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,211
I know, baby.
You are so brave.

1320
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:38,629
Mommy is so proud of you.

1321
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:43,133
Y'all need to open up
and let me in.

1322
01:29:43,133 --> 01:29:44,968
This is some emotional mess.

1323
01:29:57,689 --> 01:29:59,358
I'm happy we got him.

1324
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:00,609
Me, too.

1325
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,280
So, I was wondering.

1326
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,491
If I was to ask you out,

1327
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:08,784
what would you say?

1328
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:14,540
I'd say, what took you so long?

1329
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:19,461
I know a good restaurant.

1330
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,381
It's a date.

1331
01:30:29,763 --> 01:30:31,390
I love you, sis.

1332
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:32,891
I love you, too.
